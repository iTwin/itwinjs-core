## Description

The __@itwin/appui-react__ package contains application fragments for Login, Project, iModel and View selection, and configuration of the application UI including the Backstage, Frontstages, Widgets, etc.

The AppUI React package is a portion of the iTwin.js User Interface library. It consists of major fragments of code that combine the
functionality from the `@itwin/core-frontend` with the core-react, imodel-components and appui-layout-react packages to implement substantial
functionality that can be used within an iTwin.js application.

The package makes use of React for rendering of the user interface, and uses react-redux and its concept of the state store for
actions using reducers.

There are a number of sub-frameworks, each which has a set of components, actions, and reducers, and contributes to the overall State. Each such
sub-framework is contained in a separate folder.
