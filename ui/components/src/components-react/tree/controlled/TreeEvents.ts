/**
 * Tree events that can occur while interacting with tree.
 *
 * **Note:** Selection and checkbox state change events payload is an Observable.
 * Observable is a stream of data over time (e.g. in case of selection replaced event
 * it is a stream of selected node items arrays). To access data inside stream `subscribe()` method
 * should be called. This method accepts any subset of 'next', 'error' and 'complete' callbacks.
 * Once subscribe is called observable will start emitting data and calls 'next' callback each time new
 * data is emitted. If some selected nodes are not loaded yet they will be loaded and observable will
 * emit loaded node items. When all selected node items are emitted observable completes and calls
 * 'complete' callback if supplied.
