# iTwin.js Steering Committee Charter

The goal of the iTwin.js Steering Committee is to ensure that iTwin.js meets the needs of its users. The Steering Committee represents the voice of the user and works with iTwin.js maintainers to help guide development efforts towards solving problems for the iTwin.js community.

## Responsibilities

The Steering Committeeâ€™s responsibilities are to:

1. Provide feedback to the development team about the functionality, accessibility, and usability of iTwin.js.
2. Assist iTwin.js development team in prioritizing upcoming roadmap items and planned work.
3. Represent the "voice of the iTwin.js user" to the broader community.

## Membership

The Steering Committee memberships are not time-limited nor is there a maximum size limit.  The size of the committee is expected to vary to ensure adequate coverage in area expertise and diversity of types of users.  The Steering Committee must have a minimum of four members, and no more than one-fourth of the members may be affiliated with the same employer.

To be eligible for membership in the Steering Committee, you must:

1. Be actively developing an application or solution using iTwin.js

Candidates for membership will be nominated by current Steering Committee members or by iTwin.js maintainers.  The addition of new members will be conducted by a standard motion and vote.  A member may be removed from the Steering Committee by voluntary resignation, by a standard committee motion and vote.

The Steering Committee will elect amongst its members a Chairperson to work with the iTwin.js maintainers to build an agenda for the meetings.  The committee shall hold annual elections to select a Chairperson for a term of one year.  There are no limits on the number of terms a Chairperson may serve.

## Meetings

Meetings will happen periodically not more than once a quarter. Recordings and minutes will be posted publicly.
Subcommittees can be formed and meet more frequently or use chat rooms to discuss topics in more detail if needed.  The findings of the subcommittees will be shared in the Steering Committee regular meetings.
