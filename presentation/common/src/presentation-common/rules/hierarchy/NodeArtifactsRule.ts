/**
 * Rule used to create and assign artifacts to specific nodes. The artifacts can be
 * accessed when evaluating parent node's `hideExpression` to decide whether it should
 * be hidden or not.
 *
 * A typical use case:
 * - The hierarchy consists of *Subject* nodes and each *Subject* may or may not have child *Model* nodes. There are 2 types
 * of *Models*: *A* & *B*, we want *ModelA* nodes to be visible and *ModelB* ones to be hidden. We want *Subject* node to be
 * visible only if it has a *Model* (either *A* or *B*). In this case we can't use `hideIfNoChildren` flag on *Subjects*, because
 * a *Subject* node may only have a related *ModelB* which means *Subject* doesn't have children and should be displayed as a leaf node.
 * The solution is to use `NodeArtifacts` on the *ModelB* nodes and a `hideExpression` on *Subject* nodes. The expression can access
 * artifacts created by child *ModelB* nodes: `NOT ThisNode.HasChildren AND NOT ThisNode.ChildrenArtifacts.AnyMatches(x => x.IsModelB)`
 *
 * @note The rule is costly performance-wise and should only be used in very limited amount of specific cases where
 * hidden child nodes need to be used to used to determine parent node's visibility.
 *
 * @see [More details]($docs/presentation/Hierarchies/NodeArtifactsRule.md)
