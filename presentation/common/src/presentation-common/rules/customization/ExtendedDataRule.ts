 * Rule used to inject some extended data into presentation data

 * A couple of typical use cases:
 * - Table is showing models and elements polymorphically and application
 *   wants to handle all models and all elements differently. The rule can be used
 *   to inject some flag that tells whether table row represents a model or an element.
 * - Tree shows a hierarchy of models and elements. Then element node is clicked,
 *   application needs to additionally know element model's ID. The rule can be used
 *   to inject that ID into element's node.
