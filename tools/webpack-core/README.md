The __webpack-tools-core__ contains a set of webpack [loaders](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/loaders/) and [plugins](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/plugins/) used to build iTwin.js backend and frontends.

The main entry point for building an iTwin.js backend is the __@bentley/backend-webpack__ package and iTwin.js frontends should use __@bentley/webpack-tools__.

This package contains the following Loaders and Plugins:
