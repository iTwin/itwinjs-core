# Common Packages

Common packages contain TypeScript classes and other types that can be used by both [frontends](../frontend/index.md) and [backends](../backend/index.md).
These packages adhere to the frontend constraints of running within a web browser (for example, no file system access) but are equally relevant on either the frontend or backend.

The iModel.js common libraries are contained in the following npm packages:

* `@bentley/imodeljs-common`
* `@bentley/imodeljs-clients`
* `@bentley/geometry-core`
* `@bentley/bentleyjs-core`
