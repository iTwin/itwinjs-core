# Write An Interactive Mobile App

## 1. Write the Portable Components

See [how to write an interactive app](./WriteAnInteractiveApp.md) for a guide to writing the portable and reusable frontend and backend code.

## 2. Tailor the App

Any interactive app can be configured as a mobile app. A small additional effort is required to tailor it.

You must write a [mobile-specific main](../learning/AppTailoring.md) to do the following:
* [Configure the backend interfaces](./RpcInterface.md#3-configure-interfaces) for mobile.
* [Tailor the GUI](../learning/AppTailoring.md#change-the-gui) to suit the target mobile devices.
* [Detect and integrate platform-specific mobile functionality](../learning/AppTailoring.md#use-platform-specific-modules).

## 3. Package and Deploy
You must then package the app as a mobile app. *TBD*
