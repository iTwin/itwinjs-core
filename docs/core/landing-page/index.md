        "Infrastructure assets are complex, valuable, and long-lived, yet ever-changing. The businesses and governments that design, build, own and operate them wish to create 'Digital Twins' that accurately reflects those traits. It is obvious that no single software system can possibly meet all of those requirements at once. Rather, the businesses of infrastructure require software layers that are both flexible and open so that it can be used wherever needed and easily integrated with other systems wherever necessary. That is the design goal of the iModel.js project. It is built to be both open and transparent, while also stable and secure."

'iModel.js layers atop the most popular and most standard cloud and web technologies. It starts with <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a>, in our opinion the most productive and compelling programming ecosystem anywhere, ever. It builds on <a href="https://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com">NPM</a>, <a href="https://electronjs.org">Electron</a>, <a href="https://www.docker.com">Docker</a>, <a href="https://kubernetes.io">Kubernetes</a> and many other open source leaders, in addition to standards like HTML, CSS, and WebGL. The stack is intentionally chosen to be as mainstream and open as possible to reduce input impedance with your codebase, and to preserve your flexibility over time.'

        header: "Open, For Innovation",
        content:
"We know that when you use a set of libraries like iModel.js, you're not expecting to 'become an iModel.js developer'. Rather, you wish to incorporate code and data from many sources, joining it into a unified system and user experience. We strive that iModels and iModel.js won't be the weak link in that chain."

        header: "Open for suggestions",
        content:
"The opportunities for leveraging the hidden value of Infrastructure Digital Twins are so vast and so diverse, that its likely that many use cases will stress edge conditions in the iModel.js stack. In that cases, we suspect that you may have suggestions for enhancements, improvements or new ideas to benefit the iModel.js community. Please don't be shy about telling us how things can be improved - either with Issue reports, discussion posts, or even Pull Requests."
