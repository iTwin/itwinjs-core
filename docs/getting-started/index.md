# Getting started (offline quick start)

## 1. Get the tools

Writing an iTwin.js application requires the following software:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (12.x LTS version)
  - This provides the backend JavaScript runtime.
  - The installation also includes the `npm` command line tool.

## 2. Get the code

The starter application is located in the [desktop-starter](https://github.com/imodeljs/desktop-starter) repo on GitHub. It is an example of an Electron based application and comes with a sample snapshot iModel.

> `git clone https://github.com/imodeljs/desktop-starter.git`

## 3. Build and run a sample app

> `npm install`

> `npm start`
