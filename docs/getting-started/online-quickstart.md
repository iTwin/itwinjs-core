# Getting started (online quick start)

## 1. Get the tools

Writing an iTwin.js application requires the following software:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (12.x LTS version)
  - This provides the backend JavaScript runtime.
  - The installation also includes the `npm` command line tool.
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
  - This is the preferred tool for developing and debugging frontend JavaScript.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  - This is the source code control system for the iTwin.js repositories.

### Suggested IDE

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - This is the recommended editor and debugger for iTwin.js applications.
  - VS Code also supplies a GUI for working with Git.
