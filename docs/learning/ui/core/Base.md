# Base

The [Base]($core-react:Base) category in the `@itwin/core-react` package includes low-level classes and components for building a user interface.

## Div

The [Div]($core-react) component is a base `<div>` HTML element wrapper.

The mandatory `mainClassName` prop is used as the first value for the `className` prop for the `<div>`.

import * as React from "react";
import { CommonDivProps, Div } from "@itwin/core-react";

export function MyComponent(props: CommonDivProps) {
  return <Div {...props} mainClassName="my-css-class" />;
}
```
