# The ui-abstract package

The ui-abstract package contains abstractions for UI controls and items, such as Toolbar, Button, Menu, Backstage, StatusBar and Widget.
The imodeljs-frontend package, as well as ui-core, has a dependency on the ui-abstract package.
Therefore, code in imodeljs-frontend can use classes and interfaces in ui-abstract.
