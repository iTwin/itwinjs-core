# Wiremesh Display

The [iTwin.js renderer](./index.md) supports [displaying the edges](./EdgeDisplay.md) of surfaces, but reality models generally do not provide edge information, and sometimes it is more useful to visualize the underlying triangulation of the meshes instead. [ViewFlags.wiremesh]($common) enables wiremesh display for design models and reality models.
