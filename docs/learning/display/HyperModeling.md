# Hyper-modeling

Hyper-modeling is a way of integrating [2d documentation](./DrawingsAndSheets.md) into a spatial view. When hyper-modeling is activated, a set of [Marker]($frontend)s are displayed, corresponding to [SectionDrawingLocation]($backend)s within the spatial model. Clicking on a marker toggles the display of the corresponding drawing or sheet in 3d coordinate space, allowing the user to visualize their 2d documentation, including annotations, in the context of their spatial model.

[This sample](https://www.itwinjs.org/sample-showcase/?group=Viewer+Features&sample=hypermodeling-sample&imodel=House+Sample) provides an interactive hypermodeling demonstration.
