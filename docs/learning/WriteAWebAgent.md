# Write A Web Agent

A [Web Agent](../learning/App.md#imodel-agents) is backend code.

[iModel Query Agent](https://github.com/imodeljs/imodel-query-agent) is a complete example of an agent.

See [how to write backend code](./backend/index.md).

Typically, a Web Agent will not implement and expose RpcInterfaces, although it may call on services that do.

To develop a Web Agent, you will also:

- Register for iModelHub events
- [Package and deploy to the Web](./PackageAndDeployToTheWeb.md)
