# Supported Platforms

## Backends

iTwin.js **backends** are built and tested on the following:

- Arch Linux
- Debian 11 "Bullseye"
- Windows 10 version 1803 (or greater)
- MacOS 10.15 (or greater)

They should run on most Windows, Linux and MacOS versions with [Tier 1 support](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/BUILDING.md#platform-list) from Node.js. However, regular testing only occurs on the platforms listed above.

### Supported Node.js Versions

The following Node.js versions are officially supported by the iTwin.js backend code.

> The minimum requirements are driven by Node's compatibility with a specific N-API version. iTwin.js currently requires N-API version 8. See the [Node compatibility matrix](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html#n_api_node_api_version_matrix) for more details.

## Supported Browsers

iTwin.js strives to support as many modern browsers as possible, though it requires complete JavaScript ES6 support. The quality of the web browser's WebGL implementation has a substantial impact on display performance.

- Chrome (recommended for development)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Opera
- "New" [Chromium-based](https://www.microsoft.com/edge) Edge

> Note: Internet Explorer and "Old" Edge are **not** supported

> Note: Other Chromium-based browsers will likely work fine, but are untested.

## Electron

To enable the development of desktop applications, iTwin.js supports the latest Electron releases. As of iTwin.js 4.0, Electron 23 is the minimum requirement. See [Electron platform requirements](https://github.com/electron/electron/#platform-support) for supported Windows, Linux and MacOS versions.

## Mobile Native

The following minimum versions of mobile operating systems are supported:

- iOS 15: Minimum supported [iPhones](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/supported-models-iphe3fa5df43/15.0/ios/15.0) and [iPads](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/supported-models-ipad213a25b2/15.0/ipados/15.0)
- Android 9.0 (API Level 28)
