## Package and Deploy an iModel.js app to the Web
An iModel.js Web app is based on standard Web technology, and so you can use any Web or cloud tools to package, deploy, and administer it. iModel.js applications can be:

* hosted on any cloud service
* deployed using any [cloud deployment model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Deployment_models)
* packaged with any container tool (e.g. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/))
* managed with any orchestration system (e.g. [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/))
