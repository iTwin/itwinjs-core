# Querying Change Summaries

*Change Summaries* are summaries of changes of ECInstances in an *iModel Changeset*. **Please read [Change Summaries](../ChangeSummaries.md) first, before doing this section of the tutorial.**

Exercises for this lesson are not yet available. [Change Summaries](../ChangeSummaries.md) contains meaningful ECSQL examples as well though.
