# Common Packages

The iTwin.js common packages contain TypeScript classes and other types that can be used by both [frontends](../frontend/index.md) and [backends](../backend/index.md).
These packages adhere to the frontend constraints of running within a web browser (for example, no file system access) but are equally relevant on either the frontend or backend.

The iTwin.js common libraries are contained in the following npm packages:

- [@itwin/core-bentley](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@itwin/core-bentley)
  - ($bentley)
- [@itwin/ecschema-metadata](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@itwin/ecschema-metadata)
  - ($ecschema-metadata)
- [@itwin/core-geometry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@itwin/core-geometry)
  - ($geometry)
- [@itwin/core-common](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@itwin/core-common)
