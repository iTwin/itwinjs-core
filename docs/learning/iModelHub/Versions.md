# Named Versions

Every `Changeset` pushed to iModelHub creates a new Version of the iModel. To distinguish a specific Changeset in an iModel's timeline, that represents an important milestone or significant event for that iModel, its Version can be given a unique human-readable name, creating a Named Version (`IModelVersion.name`). It enables the Version to be easier to recognize and access.
