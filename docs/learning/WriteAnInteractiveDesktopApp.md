# Write An Interactive Desktop App

[Simple Viewer App](https://github.com/imodeljs/imodeljs-samples/tree/master/interactive-app/simple-viewer-app) is a complete example of an interactive app that can be configured as a desktop app.

## 1. Write the Portable Components

See [how to write an interactive app](./WriteAnInteractiveApp.md) for a guide to writing the portable and reusable [frontend](./Glossary.md#frontend) and [backend](./Glossary.md#backend) code.

## 2. Tailor the App

Any interactive app can be configured as a desktop app. A small additional effort is required to tailor it.

You must write an [Electron-specific main](../learning/AppTailoring.md) to do the following:

- [Configure the backend interfaces](./RpcInterface.md#configure-interfaces) for Electron.
- Integrate with Electron IPC
- Identify the main html page.

## 3. Package and Deploy

You must then package the app as an Electron app.
