# Point and Vector operations

## Notes on compact table notation

- Many arguments which might be strongly typed as `Point3d`, `Vector3d`, `Point3d`, `Vector3d` are weakly typed as `XYandZ` or `XandY`.
  - These allow any object that has `x` and `y` properties to be passed as inputs.
- Many methods have optional result args.
  - The optional arg is NOT indicated here.
  - If the caller supplies the optional arg, that preexisting object will be reinitialized.
  - If a method is being called many times in a loop, reusing a result can give a significant performance benefit.

Typical names in the tables are:

| name | implied type | remarks |
|---|---|---|
| x | number | x coordinate |
| y | number | y coordinate |
| z | number | z coordinate |
| p | Point3d or Point2d | point object |
| v | Vector3d or Vector2d | vector object |
| newVector | Vector3d or Vector2d | newly created vector object |
| basePoint | Point3d or Point2d | point object used as origin of the calculation |
| targetA, targetB | Point3d, Vector3d, Point2d, or Vector3d | point or vector used as target of a vector during the calculation |

## property verification

These are static methods on the XYZ class.  Hence they are inherited by Point3d and Vector3d. Their inputs are raw objects which may have x,y,z as properties but are not full-fledged Point3d, Vector3d, Point2d, Vector2d objects.

|condition | method |
|---|---|
| has x and y properties (z not tested) | XYZ.isXAndY (anyObject) |
| has z propertiy  | XYZ.hasZ (anyObject) |
| has x, y and z properties (z not tested) | XYZ.isXYAndZ (anyObject) |
