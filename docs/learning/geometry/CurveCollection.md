# Curve Collections

A [CurveCollection]($geometry-core) is a an abstract base class for various collection of curves.

There are 5 concrete derived types:

- [Path]($geometry-core) - curve primitives joining head to tail
- [Loop]($geometry-core) - curve primitives joining head to tail and closing to form a loop
- [ParityRegion]($geometry-core) - `Loop`s that bound a planar area by parity rules.
- [UnionRegion]($geometry-core) - boolean union of areas of `Loop`s and/or `ParityRegion`s

## `Path` and `Loop`

`Path` and `Loop` are collections for which

- All members of the collection must be derived from [CurvePrimitive]($geometry-core), i.e. be one of
  - [LineSegment3d]($geometry-core)
  - [Arc3d]($geometry-core)
  - [BSplineCurve3d]($geometry-core)
  - [TransitionSpiral3d]($geometry-core)
- Successive `CurvePrimitive` members must match "head to tail".
- In a `Loop`, the last member's head must match the first member's tail.
- Throughout the library, a `Loop` is expected to be a "filled" planar region.
- A `Path` is usually does _not_ return to its start point.
  - If a `Path` _does_ return to its start point, it is _not_ interpreted as enclosing area.  The path is still just a wire that happens to come back to its start.

 The immediate base class for both `Path` and `Loop` is `CurveChain`.   The `CurveChain` base class implements various methods that depend on the internal head-to-tail matching but _not_ on the closure of a `Loop`.

### Special `Loop` properties

- The purpose of a `Loop` is to act as the boundary of a planar region.
  - Unless specifically indicated by names or comments for various methods that at on `Loop`s,  The containing plane will be determine "on demand" using the `FrameBuilder` class.
- A point is "inside" a loop if a line (within the `Loop`'s plane) from the point "to infinity"  crosses the loop an odd number of times.
- The crossing count rule may be applied (and mathematically always produces the same result) for:
  - Any line direction -- horizontal, vertical, or any other direction.
  - Any curved path that starts at the and gets to infinity.

## `ParityRegion`

A `ParityRegion` is a curve collection whose immediate children are

- _all_ of type `Loop` (i.e. array of `CurvePrimitive` joined head-to-tail both internally an from last to first.
- all coplanar.

"Inside" and "Outside" of a parity region is determined by the rule commonly called "even/odd", "exclusive or" or "parity":

- A point is "inside" the parity region if and only if it is classified as "inside" of an odd number of its `Loop`s.
- A point is "inside" if and only if performing "exclusive or" among the (boolean) "inside" classification of all of its `Loop`s.

In nearly all uses, the various loops in a `ParityRegion`

- have no intersections among any pair of loops.
- have exactly one that can be called `outer`
- all other than the `outer`

## `UnionRegion`

A `UnionRegion` is a curve collection whose immediate children are

- limited to the two types `Loop` and `ParityRegion`.
- all coplanar.

"Inside" and "Outside" of a parity region is determined by the boolean "union" or "OR" rule:

- A point is "inside" the union region if it is "inside" _one or more_ of the members.
- A point is "inside" if and only if performing "union" among the (boolean) "inside" classification of all of its `Loop` and `ParityRegion`.

## Tips for Processing `CurveCollection`s

Processing all 5 subtypes of `CurveCollection` initially appears quite complex.  However, within each of the cases of a top level switch statement or sequence of `if` tests, the number of possibilities drops quickly:

- A `Path` or `Loop` can _only_ contain true `CurvePrimitive`.
- A `ParityRegion` may only contain `Loop`s.
- A `UnionRegion` may contain only `Loop`, `ParityRegion`, or further `UnionRegion`.
- A `BagOfCurves` is the only one with free mixture of both `CurveCollection` and `CurvePrimitive`.
