# Create a snapshot iModel

Get started with iModel.js in your local environment. It is free, with no iTwin subscription requirement or trial periods.

[Snapshot iModels]($docs/learning/backend/accessingimodels.md/#snapshot-imodels) are a static but intelligent format representing the state of an iModel at a point in time. Once created, they can not be modified. And do not have a connection with iModelHub.
