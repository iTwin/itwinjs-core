# Create a snapshot iModel

Get started with iTwin.js in your local environment. It is free, with no iTwin subscription requirement or trial periods.

[Snapshot iModels]($docs/learning/backend/accessingimodels.md/#snapshot-imodels) are a static but intelligent format representing the state of an iModel at a point in time. Once created, they can not be modified. And do not have a connection with iModelHub.

## Download iTwin Snapshot

Download and familiarize yourself with the [iTwin Snapshot]($docs/learning/tutorials/itwin-snapshot-app.md), a free tool for creating snapshots.

1. Choose where to save the snapshot on your local drive
1. Select local files by clicking "+"
