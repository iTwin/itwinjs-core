# Create a snapshot iModel

Get started with iTwin.js in your local environment. It is free, with no iTwin subscription requirement or trial periods.

[Snapshot iModels](../backend/accessingimodels.md/#snapshot-imodels) are a static but intelligent format representing the state of an iModel at a point in time. Once created, they can not be modified. And do not have a connection with iModelHub.

## Download iTwin Snapshot

Download and familiarize yourself with the [iTwin Snapshot](./itwin-snapshot-app.md), a free tool for creating snapshots.

## Create a snapshot iModel

1. Launch Snapshot App
1. Select "Create snapshot"
1. Sign In
1. Provide a name for the snapshot
1. Choose where to save the snapshot on your local drive
1. Select local files by clicking "+"
1. Click "Create"
1. Enable any required connectors

The iTwin Snapshot will download and extract the needed connectors, run the connectors on the selected files, and generate the snapshot to the chosen location.

Next, follow the ["Developing a desktop viewer"](./develop-desktop-viewer.md) tutorial to view the snapshot.
