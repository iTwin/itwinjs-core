# Developing a desktop viewer

## Setup

- [Install necessary prerequisites]($docs/getting-started/development-prerequisites)
- [Clone desktop-starter repo](https://github.com/imodeljs/desktop-starter)

The app will open a pre-packaged offline snapshot iModel. You will likely want to use your own snapshot iModel. Follow the [Create a snapshot iModel]($docs/learning/tutorials/create-test-imodel-offline) tutorial. Then open your snapshot by clicking the Home button and selecting "Open Offline Snapshot".

Desktop apps can also open cloud hosted iModels. If you do not have access to one, follow one of our tutorials to [create an online iModel]($docs/learning/tutorials/index.md). Then open your online iModel by selecting "Open Online iModel" and logging in.
