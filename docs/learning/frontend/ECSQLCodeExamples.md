# Frontend ECSQL Code Examples

For working directly with an iModel from the frontend, an [IModelConnection]($frontend) is used.

Use [IModelConnection.createQueryReader]($frontend) to create an [ECSqlReader]($common) that can be used to interact with the results from the executed ECSQL statement.

**Refer to the [general ECSQL Code Examples](../ECSQLCodeExamples.md).** All of the references to an `iModel` object in those examples can be considered IModelConnection objects.
