# User Preferences in iTwin.js

User preferences allow applications to persist settings across a user's sessions, where the settings can be customized by the user of the application. The preferences may be applicable for the application itself or dependent on a specific iTwin or iModel.

User preferences are separate from any iTwin or iModel configuration intended to be shared across multiple users and administered by an admin rather than each individual user. See [Workspace](../backend/Workspace.md) for more details on shared workspace and settings.

Examples of user preferences include tool settings; recently accessed models, views, or projects; user interface state; etc.
