# Concurrency Control

Concurrency control is a way to coordinate simultaneous transactions (briefcases) while preserving data integrity. Concurrency control is implemented in the code of an app and is based on the identity of a briefcase. Concurrency control should not to be confused with user access control. To make coordinated changes, an app must follow 3 basic rules:

1. [Reserve Codes](#code-reservation) before using them.
1. Optionally lock models and elements before modifying them, depending on the iModel's [concurrency control policy](#concurrency-control-policies)
1. [Pull and merge](./IModelDbSync.md) before pushing.

An iModel has a concurrency control policy that specifies how multiple briefcases may modify models and elements. The policy may stipulate that locks must be used, forcing transactions to be sequential (pessimistic), or it may specify change-merging with conflict-resolution to combine the results of simultaneous transactions (optimistic).

An app uses [BriefcaseDb]($backend) and [ConcurrencyControl]($backend) to follow concurrency control rules.

Locks and code reservations are associated with a briefcase while it is making changes and are released when it pushes.

## Background

This article assumes that you already know that:

- An iModel is a multi-user database
- An app works with a [briefcase](../Glossary.md#Briefcase) using the [BriefcaseDb]($backend) class.
- A briefcase has a unique identity that is issued and tracked by [iModelHub]($docs/learning/IModelHub/index.md).
- Changes are captured and distributed in the form of [ChangeSets]($docs/learning/IModelHub/briefcases.md).
- ChangeSets are ordered in a sequence that is called the [timeline]($docs/learning/IModelHub/index.md#the-timeline-of-changes-to-an-imodel) of the iModel.
- ChangeSets are stored in iModelHub
- A [Code](../Glossary.md#Code) is an identifier that is assigned to an element and is managed by a central Code Service.

## Code Reservation

An app must reserve all Codes that it plans to assign to elements during a local editing session. An app can reserve more Codes than it actually uses. For example, an app may reserve a range or block of Codes in a sequence to ensure that it can use them, but before it knows exactly how many it will need. When the local ChangeSet is finally pushed, the Code Service sorts out which reserved Codes were actually used and which were not. Unused Codes are returned to the pool, while used Codes are marked as used and unavailable. When an element is deleted, its Code may be returned to the pool.

See [below](#how-and-when-to-acquire-locks-and-reserve-codes) for how and when to reserve codes.

<!-- TODO: Check if the Code of a deleted element becomes available for assignment to another element or not. -->

## Concurrency Control Policies

Preemptive locking is always required when importing Schemas or changing or inserting CodeSpecs. The APIs for those objects take care of locking automatically.

For models and elements, there are two locking policy options: pessimistic and optimistic. The [ConcurrencyControl]($backend) class specifies the concurrency control policy for an iModel. The app must check the `iModelDb.concurrencyControl` property to learn the policy and then implement it.

### Pessimistic Concurrency Control

To set up an iModel to use the pessimistic concurrency control policy, specify the ConcurrencyControl.PessimisticPolicy, as follows:

```typescript
iModel.concurrencyControl.setPolicy(new ConcurrencyControl.PessimisticPolicy());
```

The pessimistic concurrency policy requires that models and elements must be locked before local changes can be pushed to iModelHub. Locking prevents concurrent changes and forces briefcase transactions affecting the same models and elements to be sequential.

For reference, the pessimistic locking rules are as follows:

| Operation      | LockType          | Lock Level |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| Insert element | Model             | Shared     |
| Modify element | Element           | Exclusive  |
| Delete element | Element           | Exclusive  |
| Insert model   | DgnDb             | Shared     |
| Modify model   | Model             | Exclusive  |
| Delete model   | Model             | Exclusive  |
| "              | Elements in model | Exclusive  |

An app will normally implement the pessimistic policy by using high-level APIs to build lock requests based on the intended operation, as explained [below](#how-to-acquire-locks-and-reserve-codes). These high-level APIs take care of both acquiring locks and reserving Codes.

A briefcase must pull before it can lock an element or model if it is affected by a recently pushed ChangeSet.

An app that implements the pessimistic concurrency control policy follows the pull -> lock -> change -> push pattern.

![pessimistic concurrency example workflow](./PessimisticConcurrencyControl.jpg)

Locks are normally released when the briefcase pushes its changes, or they may be released if the briefcase abandons its changes.

### Optimistic Concurrency Control

To set up an iModel to use optimistic concurrency control, specify the ConcurrencyControl.OptimisticPolicy, as follows:

```typescript
iModel.concurrencyControl.setPolicy(new ConcurrencyControl.OptimisticPolicy());
```

An optimistic concurrency policy allows apps to modify elements and models in an iModel without acquiring locks. In this case, the app uses change-merging to reconcile local changes before pushing.

Working without locks opens up the possibility that other apps may add ChangeSets to the timeline while the local editing session is in progress. The briefcase must then merge before it can push.

Suppose, for example, that two briefcases were editing different properties of the same element at the same time. Suppose that the first briefcase pushed first, creating ChangeSet#1. Now, the second briefcase must pull and merge before it can push.

![optimistic concurrency example workflow](./OptimisticConcurrencyControl.jpg)

#### Conflicts

Working without locks also opens up the possibility that local changes may overlap with in-coming ChangeSets. When ChangeSets are merged into the briefcase, the change-merging algorithm checks for conflicts. The algorithm merges changes and checks for conflicts at the level of individual element properties. In the example above, the two briefcases changed different properties of the same element. That is not a conflict. Likewise, it is not a conflict for two briefcases both to set a property to the same value, or for two briefcases both to delete an element. Conflicts arise if the two briefcases set the same property to different values, or if one briefcase modifies a property and the other deletes the element.

If conflicts are found, the change-merging algorithm applies the iModel's conflict-resolution policy. This can be accessed using the [BriefcaseDb.concurrencyControl]($backend) property. The policy object includes a [ConcurrencyControl.ConflictResolutionPolicy]($backend) that specifies a conflict-handling policy for each combination of changes that could conflict. The handling operations are defined by [ConcurrencyControl.OnConflict]($backend). The default conflict-resolution policies are:

| Local Change | RemoteChange | Resolution                                  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| update       | update       | RejectIncomingChange                        |
| update       | delete       | AcceptIncomingChange (reject not support)   |
| delete       | update       | RejectIncomingChange (accept not supported) |

Property-level change-merging is very fine-grained, and so it allows many kinds of changes to be made simultaneously without conflicts. A schema may also specify rules to check for conflicts on a higher level.

Only models and elements may be changed optimistically. Locking is required when importing Schemas or changing or inserting CodeSpecs.

## How and When to Acquire Locks and Reserve Codes

This section describes how an app reserves Codes and/or acquires locks. There are two options for when and how to do this during a local transaction: before making changes (pessimistic) or after making changes (optimistic). Or, you can acquire resources ahead of time.

### Acquiring locks ahead of time

To lock one or more elements and/or models exclusively, call ConcurrencyControl.requestResourcesForUpdate, passing the elements to be locked in the second argument (if any) and the models to be locked in the third argument.

### Reserving codes ahead of time

The following function are available to manage Codes:
* [ConcurrencyControl.Codes.reserve]($backend) to reserve Codes before using them in elements.
* ConcurrencyControl.hasReservedCode to check if a Code has already been reserved. This is a quick check against the local resources cache.
* [ConcurrencyControl.Codes.query]($backend) to send a request to the server to learn the status of a Code or family of Codes.
* [ConcurrencyControl.abandonResources]($backend) to preemptively release all locks and Codes currently held by the briefcase.

If you call BriefcaseDb.pushChanges, all locks are released, all used Codes are marked as used, and unused Codes are relinquished.

### Acquiring locks and/or codes pessimistically

1.  Call [ConcurrencyControl.requestResources]($backend) on the elements and/or models that you intended to insert, update, of delete to request the locks and/or codes that the planned local operations will require. This may send a request to iModelHub.
1.  If the request fails, cancel the local operation.
1.  If the request succeeds, go ahead with the local operation, make the planned local changes, and then call [IModelDb.saveChanges]($backend).

This approach is the safest way to avoid conflicts. It requires that the app must plan ahead before making local changes.

This approach is _required_ when the iModel's locking policy is set to pessimistic.
This approach may be used when the iModel's locking policy is set to optimistic.

Note that sending a request to iModelHub is a relatively expensive operation. Therefore it is important to batch up requests for locks and/or Codes.

If you call BriefcaseDb.pushChanges, all locks are released, all used Codes are marked as used, and unused Codes are relinquished.

### Acquiring locks and/or codes optimistically

1.  Insert or update models and elements.
1.  Call [ConcurrencyControl.request]($backend) to request the locks and codes that those local operations require.
1.  If the request fails, call [IModelDb.abandonChanges]($backend) to roll back the local transaction.
1.  If the request succeeds, call [IModelDb.saveChanges]($backend) to commit the local transaction.

The optimistic approach is simpler than using the pessimistic approach, but it carries the risk that you must abandon all of your changes in case of a locking or code-reservation conflict. Use this approach only if you know that your changes are isolated such that conflicts are unlikely.

This approach is available _only_ when the iModel's locking policy is set to optimistic.

If you call BriefcaseDb.pushChanges, all locks are released, all used Codes are marked as used, and unused Codes are relinquished.

## ChangeSets and Schema Changes

The special schema lock must be acquired before importing a schema into a briefcase. Also, schema changes must be isolated in a dedicated ChangeSet, separate from other kinds of changes. This is true for all concurrency control policies. To import a schema, an app must:

1. Pull and merge to synchronize with the tip.
1. Push any local changes to iModelHub.
1. Perform the schema import in a local transaction.
1. Push the results of the schema import as a ChangeSet to iModelHub.
