# IModelHost

A [backend](../Glossary.md#backend) must call [IModelHost.startup]($backend) before using any of the classes in imodeljs-backend. IModelHost initializes imodeljs-backend and captures backend configuration.

A backend may need to set [IModelHostConfiguration.cacheDir]($backend) based on deployment parameters

A backend may need to set [IModelHostConfiguration.appAssetsDir]($backend) to identify its own assets directory. This would be needed, for example, if the app needs to [import ECSchemas](./SchemasAndElementsInTypeScript.md) that it delivers.

*Example:*

```ts
[[include:IModelHost.startup]]
```
