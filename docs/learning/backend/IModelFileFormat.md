# iModel File Format

An iModel is a specialized SQLite database file that stores infrastructure asset information according to the [BIS (Base Infrastructure Schemas)](../../bis/index.md) standard. Understanding the internal structure and reserved elements of an iModel file is important for backend developers working with iModel data.

## Database Structure

iModels are based on the [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) relational database format, providing:

- **Transactional integrity** - ACID compliance for data consistency
- **Portability** - Single-file databases that work across platforms
- **Performance** - Efficient indexing and query planning
- **Embedded storage** - No separate server process required

The iModel extends SQLite with:

- [BIS-defined schemas](../../bis/index.md) mapped to database tables
- [ECSQL](../ECSQL.md) query language for class-based queries
- Change tracking for distributed synchronization via [ChangeSets](../Glossary.md#changeset)

## Pre-created Elements

Every newly created iModel contains several pre-initialized elements with reserved IDs:

| Element ID  | ECClass               | Purpose              |
| ----------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| `0x1` (1)   | `Subject`             | Root Subject         |
| `0xe` (14)  | `LinkPartition`       | Reality Data Sources |
| `0x10` (16) | `DefinitionPartition` | Dictionary Model     |

## Reserved Element IDs

**Element IDs 2 through 13 (0x2 - 0xd) are reserved for internal system use and should not be used for application data.**

Currently, these reserved IDs serve special internal purposes:

- **ID 2 (0x2)**: Currently used to manage **schema table locks** for concurrent schema modifications in multi-user scenarios.

### Why Reserved IDs Are Safe

In normal operation, application code will not accidentally use these reserved IDs because new element IDs are generated by combining the briefcase's ID with a sequential counter in the lower 40 bits.
