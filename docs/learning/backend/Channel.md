# Working with "Editing Channels" in iModels

An "Editing Channel" (hereinafter just "Channel") is a tree of models and elements below one *Channel Root* `Subject` element. Channels segregate the contents of an iModel into *sections* to provide access control over which applications may change which data. The concept is *cooperative* in that applications indicate the channels to which they pertain, and any attempt to modify data outside one of those channels is denied with a *channel constraint* exception at runtime.

To help visualize how channels are used, imagine an iModel with the following breakdown:

RootSubject
- Subject0
  - PhysicalPartition01
    - Model01
      - Elements ...
- <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">Subject1</span>
  - <span style="color:green">PhysicalPartition11</span>
    - <span style="color:green">Model11</span>
      - <span style="color:green">Elements ...</span>

- <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">Subject2</span>
  - <span style="color:blue">PhysicalPartition21</span>
    - <span style="color:blue">Model21</span>
      - <span style="color:blue">Elements ...</span>
  - <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">Subject21</span>
    - <span style="color:blue">PhysicalPartition211</span>
      - <span style="color:blue">Model211</span>
        - <span style="color:blue">Elements ...</span>

In this example, <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">Subject1</span> and <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">Subject2</span> are channel root elements. All of the elements and models under them are in their respective channels. Color-coding is used to identify the two channels in this example. Everything in <span style="color:green">green</span> is in the first channel, <span style="color:blue">blue</span> is in the second channel.

Not everything in an iModel is in a channel. Everything that is not below a *Channel Root* `Subject` element is considered part of the *Shared Channel*. The Shared Channel may be modified by all applications. In the diagram above, everything in black is in the Shared Channel.

## ChannelKeys

Every channel has a `channelKey` that is used for controlling write access to it.

>Note: `channelKey` is distinct from the Code of the Channel root element. It is a key chosen by the application that creates a channel and is not visible to the user. A particular `channelKey` can only be used by one Channel root Element in an iModel.

In order to minimize collisions, `channelKeys` shall follow the convention:

[organization-name]:[application-name]:[extension-name-if-any]

For example, "bentley:opensiteplus" or "bentley:localsync:mstn"

## ChannelControl

Every `IModelDb` has a member [IModelDb.channels]($backend) of type [ChannelControl]($backend) that supplies methods for controlling which channels are editable during a session.

The method [ChannelControl.getChannelKey]($backend) will return the `channelKey` for an element given an `ElementId`.
The method [ChannelControl.queryChannelRoot]($backend) will return the `ElementId` of the ChannelRoot element for a given `channelKey`, if one exists.

### Allowed Channels

The `ChannelControl` member of an IModelDb holds a set of allowed (i.e. editable) channels. Any attempt to add/delete/update an [Element]($backend), [ElementAspect]($backend), or [Model]($backend) whose `channelKey` is not in the set of Allowed Channels will generate a `ChannelConstraintViolation` exception.

After opening an `IModelDb` but before editing it, applications should call [ChannelControl.addAllowedChannel]($backend) one or more times with the `channelKey`(s) for which editing should be allowed. To stop editing a channel, call [ChannelControl.removeAllowedChannel]($backend).

For example:

```ts
    imodel.channels.addAllowedChannel("bentley:structural");
```

Later, to disallow editing of that channel call:

```ts
    imodel.channels.removeAllowedChannel("bentley:structural");
```

> Note: The "shared" channel is not editable by default. To allow writing to the shared channel, you need to call `imodel.channels.addAllowedChannel(ChannelControl.sharedChannelName)`

### Creating New Channels

To create a new *Channel Root* `Subject` element (and thereby a new channel), use [ChannelControl.insertChannelSubject]($backend) with the `channelKey` identifying the new channel.

E.g.:

```ts
  imodel.channels.insertChannelSubject({ subjectName: "Chester", channelKey: "bentley:structural" });
```

Generally, *Channel Root* `Subject` elements are created as an child of the *Root Subject*. However, `insertChannelSubject` accepts an optional `parentSubjectId` argument so that *Channel Root* Subjects can appear elsewhere in the Subject hierarchy. However, channels may not nest. Attempts to create a *Channel Root* element within an existing channel other than the "shared" Channel will throw an exception.

## Channels vs. Locks

Locks and Channels are orthogonal concepts. To edit an element, its channel must be allowed AND its lock must be held.

Each is possible without the other:
  - If another user holds the lock on an element, editing is denied even though it is an allowed channel.
  - An element may have been edited in a previous session or by another application in the same session. In that case the lock may be held, but further edits are denied if its channel is not allowed.

## Semantic Versioning of Channels

Data organization in a channel reflects the layout of information that a particular version of an editing application expects. Such data organization may change in future versions of the same editing application. Applications can use the `ChannelRootAspect.Version` property in order to apply _semantic versioning_ to a Channel.

_Semantic versioning_ uses the pattern [read-compatibility].[write-compatibility].[minor-increment] in order to communicate whether changes introduced in a version are backwards compatible for reading, writing or both.

The _semantic version_ of a channel shall be set by an Editing Application when it either creates a channel, or when it upgrades its data organization from an older version.

Consider the following examples:

Version 1 of an Editing application organizes its elements into two Subjects, one leading to its Physical Elements, and a second one leading to its Definition Elements.

RootSubject
- Channel Subject
  - Subject1
    - PhysicalPartition
      - PhysicalModel
        - Physical Elements ...
  - Subject2
    - DefinitionPartition
      - DefinitionModel
        - Definition Elements ...

The initial version of this channel is set to 1.0.0.

### Minor increments

Let's assume that Version 2 of the same Editing application adds a new Subject in order to capture Documents.

RootSubject
- Channel Subject
  - Subject1
    - PhysicalPartition
      - PhysicalModel
        - Physical Elements ...
  - Subject2
    - DefinitionPartition
      - DefinitionModel
        - Definition Elements ...
  - <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">Subject3</span>
    - <span style="color:green">DocumentPartition</span>
      - <span style="color:green">DocumentListModel</span>
        - <span style="color:green">Document Elements ...</span>

This kind of change is read and write backwards-compatible since Version 1 of the Editing Application would still able to find the data it is aware of (under Subject1 and Subject2) and modify it in such a channel. Therefore, only the _minor-increment_ number of the version of the channel needs to be modified: 1.0.1.

Note that an instance of Version 1 of the Editing Application to access the channel should not update its version since it indicates it has newer addition to what it is aware of.

### Read-compatibility

Let's assume Version 2 of the Editing Application introduced a different organization under Subject2, introducing some new logic to store a certain kind of Definition Elements that used to be stored in Subject2, now in the new Subject21. Thefore, Definition Elements are now stored under two different Subjects as opposed to one in the previous version.

RootSubject
- Channel Subject
  - Subject1
    - PhysicalPartition
      - PhysicalModel
        - Physical Elements ...
  - Subject2
    - DefinitionPartition
      - DefinitionModel
        - Definition Elements ...
    - <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">Subject21</span>
      - <span style="color:green">DefinitionPartition</span>
        - <span style="color:green">DefinitionModel</span>
          - <span style="color:green">Definition Elements ...</span>

Since version 1 of the Editing application is unaware of this new organization of Definition Elements, it would not be able to find them correctly. Thus, this is a read-incompatible change that needs to be communicated by incrementing the _read-compatible_ number of the version of the channel: 2.0.0.

An instance of Version 1 of the Editing Application shall fail early and not attempt to read or write data in the channel.

### Write-compatibility

Finally, let's assume Version 2 of the Editing application introduced a new Subject3 that leads to Physical elements that are generated and kept in-sync based on data in Subject1 and Subject2.

RootSubject
- Channel Subject
  - Subject1
    - PhysicalPartition
      - PhysicalModel
        - Physical Elements ...
  - Subject2
    - DefinitionPartition
      - DefinitionModel
        - Definition Elements ...
  - <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">Subject3</span>
    - <span style="color:green">PhysicalPartition</span>
      - <span style="color:green">PhysicalModel</span>
        - <span style="color:green">Physical Elements ...</span>

Version 1 of the Editing application would be able to find all the data it is aware of, but it wouldn't be able to safely modify it since this new data organization has the expectation of certain elements to be generated or kept in-sync according to data in the other Subjects. Thus, this is an example of a read-compatible but write-incompatible change, communicated by incrementing the _write-compatible_ number of the version of the channel: 1.1.0.

In this case, an instance of Version 1 of the Editing Application shall only access the channel for read-only purposes.
