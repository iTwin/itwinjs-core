# ECSQL Code Examples

> The code examples do not explicitly show examples using the [ECDb]($backend) class. However, the code examples work likewise for
> ECDb. Just replace [IModelDb.withPreparedStatement]($backend) in the code examples
> with [ECDb.withPreparedStatement]($backend).

Also see [frequently used ECSQL queries](./ECSQL-queries.md) for the specific ECSQL queries that app backends and services often run.

## Parameter Bindings

### Binding per parameter

#### Positional parameters

```ts
[[include:ExecuteECSql_Binding_ByParameter_Positional]]
```

#### Named parameters

```ts
[[include:ExecuteECSql_Binding_ByParameter_Named]]
```

### Binding to all parameters at once

See section "[ECSQL parameter types in iTwin.js](../ECSQLParameterTypes.md)" to learn which types to use for the parameters when binding all
parameters at once.

#### Positional parameters

```ts
[[include:ExecuteECSql_BindValues_Positional]]
```

#### Named parameters

```ts
[[include:ExecuteECSql_BindValues_Named]]
```

### Navigation properties

[Navigation properties](../ECSQL.md#navigation-properties) are structs made up of the Id of the related instance and the backing
ECRelationshipClass. The [NavigationBindingValue]($common) interface is used to bind values to navigation property parameters.

```ts
[[include:ExecuteECSql_Binding_Navigation_ByParameter]]
```

```ts
[[include:ExecuteECSql_BindValues_Navigation]]
```

Because of the struct nature of navigation properties, you can also use its members in the ECSQL. The two following examples illustrate
this by specifying the **Id** member of a navigation property.

```ts
[[include:ExecuteECSql_Binding_NavigationId_ByParameter]]
```

```ts
[[include:ExecuteECSql_BindValues_NavigationId]]
```

### Struct properties

You can either parameterize a struct property as a whole or parameterize individual members of the struct. See "[Struct properties in ECSQL](../ECSQL.md#structs)" for the ECSQL background.

> The ECSQL examples used in this section refer to the sample ECSchema in "[Struct properties in ECSQL](../ECSQL.md#structs)".

#### Binding structs as a whole

```ts
[[include:ExecuteECSql_Binding_Struct_ByParameter]]
```

```ts
[[include:ExecuteECSql_BindValues_Struct]]
```

#### Binding to individual struct members

```ts
[[include:ExecuteECSql_Binding_StructMembers_ByParameter]]
```

```ts
[[include:ExecuteECSql_BindValues_StructMembers]]
```

> The two ECSQL examples used in this section amount to the same results.

### Array properties

See "[Array properties in ECSQL](../ECSQL.md#arrays)" for the ECSQL background.

> The ECSQL examples used in this section refer to the sample ECSchema in "[Array properties in ECSQL](../ECSQL.md#arrays)".

```ts
[[include:ExecuteECSql_Binding_Array_ByParameter]]
```

```ts
[[include:ExecuteECSql_BindValues_Array]]
```

## Working with the query result

The current row of the query result can be retrieved in two ways:

- as a whole as JavaScript literal (adhering to the [ECSQL row format](../ECSQLRowFormat.md))
- column by column (using the [ECSqlValue]($backend) API as returned from [ECSqlStatement.getValue]($backend))

> The column by column approach is more low-level, but gives you more flexible access to the data in the row. For example,
> [ECClassIds](../ECSQL.md#ECInstanceId-and-ECClassId) are turned into class names in the [ECSQL row format](../ECSQLRowFormat.md).
> Using the [ECSqlValue]($backend) API allows you to retrieve ECClassIds as Id64s.

### Rows as a whole

The following example is intended to illustrate the [ECSQL row format](../ECSQLRowFormat.md):

```ts
[[include:ExecuteECSql_GetRow_IllustrateRowFormat]]
```

#### Output

```json
{id: "0x312", className: "StructuralPhysical.Slab", parent: {id: "0x433", relClassName: "BisCore.PhysicalElementAssemblesElements"}, lastMod: "2018-02-03T13:43:22Z"}

{id: "0x313", className: "StructuralPhysical.Slab", parent: {id: "0x5873", relClassName: "BisCore.PhysicalElementAssemblesElements"}, lastMod: "2017-11-24T08:21:01Z"}

...
```

> Note how the ECProperties used in the ECSQL are converted to members of the JavaScript literal and how their names are
> transformed according to the rules described in the [ECSQL row format](../ECSQLRowFormat.md#property-names).

The following example illustrates how to work with the ECSQL row JavaScript literal:

```ts
[[include:ExecuteECSql_GetRow]]
```

#### Output

ECInstanceId | ClassName | Parent Id | Parent RelClassName | LastMod
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
0x312 | StructuralPhysical.Slab | 0x433 | BisCore.PhysicalElementAssemblesElements | 2018-02-03T13:43:22Z
0x313 | StructuralPhysical.Slab | 0x5873 | BisCore.PhysicalElementAssemblesElements | 2017-11-24T08:21:01Z
... | | | |

### Column by column

```ts
[[include:ExecuteECSql_GetValue]]
```

#### Output

ECInstanceId | ClassName | Parent Id | Parent RelClassName | LastMod
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
0x312 | StructuralPhysical.Slab | 0x433 | BisCore.PhysicalElementAssemblesElements | 2018-02-03T13:43:22Z
0x313 | StructuralPhysical.Slab | 0x5873 | BisCore.PhysicalElementAssemblesElements | 2017-11-24T08:21:01Z
... | | | |

> The sample is code is intentionally verbose to better illustrate the semantics of the API.

The following example illustrates the flexibility of the column by column approach by preserving the [ECClassId](../ECSQL.md#ECInstanceId-and-ECClassId)
as id instead of having it converted to a class name.

```ts
[[include:ExecuteECSql_GetValue_PreserveClassIds]]
```

#### Output

ECClassId | Parent RelECClassId
--- | ---
0x120 | 0x154
0x120 | 0x154
... |
