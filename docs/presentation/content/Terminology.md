# Content-related terminology

## Input class

An ECClass of ECInstance we requested content for.

## Input instance

An ECInstance we requested content for.

## Primary instance

ECInstance whose properties are loaded at the root level of the content record.

This usually but not necessarily matches [input instance](#input-instance) â€” it depends on the [content specifications](./index.md#specifications) that produce content:

- [Selected node instances](./SelectedNodeInstances.md) specification returns content records whose input instance matches primary instance.
- [Content related instances](./contentRelatedInstances.md) specification returns content records whose input instance doesn't match primary instance. Instead, the primary instance is related to the input instance through a relationship defined in the specification.
- [Content instances of specific classes](./contentInstancesOfSpecificClasses.md) specification returns content records that don't rely on input instances at all.

Content records may also contain properties of [related instances](#related-instance).

## Primary class

An ECClass of the [primary instance](#primary-instance).

## Related instance

ECInstance that is related to [primary instance](#primary-instance).

## Related properties

Properties that belong to a [related instance](#related-instance) rather than [primary instance](#primary-instance).

## Property merging

When content is requested for multiple different classes and they all have similar properties, multiple properties may get merged under one field.

> **Example:**
>
> Requesting content for *Window* and *Door* classes which both have property *Height* - content will contain only one field with name *Height* and values of both *Window* and *Door* instances will be put under that field.

Properties are considered similar if:

- Names are equal
- Types are equal
- Renderers are equal
- Editors are equal
- For [related properties](#related-properties) only: related to the same property

## Value merging

When content is requested with [ContentFlags.MergeResults]($presentation-common) flag and contains more than 1 result row, its values are merged into 1 record. This is generally used only for property pane use case where we may request content for multiple selected elements.

> **Example** of merged values:
>
> | Row        | Field 1       | Field 2                | Field 1                |
> | ---------- | ------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
> | row 1      | has value     | has value              | -                      |
> | row 2      | has value     | -                      | has value              |
> | **Result** | **has value** | **\*\*\*Varies\*\*\*** | **\*\*\*Varies\*\*\*** |
>
> The above example would render into a similar property grid:
>
> | Field       | Value              |
> | ----------- | ------------------ |
> | **Field 1** | has value          |
> | **Field 2** | \*\*\*Varies\*\*\* |
> | **Field 3** | \*\*\*Varies\*\*\* |

## Nested content

In most cases property values are primitive, arrays or structs. However, it is possible to set up [related properties](#related-properties) using one-to-many or many-to-many relationship which creates, what we call, the nested content.

> **Example:**
>
> ```text
>            Model
>           /  |  \
>          /   |   \
>         /    |    \
> Element1 Element2 Element3
> ```
>
> In the above example *Model* has 3 related *Element* instances. We can request content for *Model* and ask to additionally show related *Element* properties. In this case element properties are called **nested content** because properties of multiple *Element* instances are displayed as a single *Model* property. The property is created as an array of structs where each struct is created from *Element* instance.
