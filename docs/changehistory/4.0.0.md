## Breaking Changes

### Updated minimum requirements

A new major release of iTwin.js affords us the opportunity to update our requirements to continue to provide modern, secure, and rich libraries. Please visit our [Supported Platforms](../learning/SupportedPlatforms) documentation for a full breakdown.

#### Node.js

Node 12 reached [end-of-life](https://github.com/nodejs/release#end-of-life-releases) in 2020, and Node 14 as well as Node 16 will do so shortly. iTwin.js 4.0 requires a minimum of Node 18.12.0, though we recommend using the latest long-term-support version.

#### WebGL

Web browsers display 3d graphics using an API called [WebGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL), which comes in 2 versions: WebGL 1, released 11 years ago; and WebGL 2, released 6 years ago. WebGL 2 provides many more capabilities than WebGL 1. Because some browsers (chiefly Safari) did not provide support for WebGL 2, iTwin.js has maintained support for both versions, which imposed some limitations on the features and efficiency of its rendering system.

Over a year ago, support for WebGL 2 finally became [available in all major browsers](https://www.khronos.org/blog/webgl-2-achieves-pervasive-support-from-all-major-web-browsers). iTwin.js now **requires** WebGL 2 - WebGL 1 is no longer supported. This change will have no effect on most users, other than to improve their graphics performance. However, users of iOS will need to make sure they have upgraded to iOS 15 or newer to take advantage of WebGL 2 (along with the many other benefits of keeping their operating system up to date).

[IModelApp.queryRenderCompatibility]($frontend) will now produce [WebGLRenderCompatibilityStatus.CannotCreateContext]($webgl-compatibility) for a client that does not support WebGL 2.

#### Electron

Electron versions from 14 to 17 reached their end-of-life last year, and for this reason, support for these versions were dropped. To be able to drop Node 16, Electron 22 was also dropped. iTwin.js now supports Electron 23 and Electron 24.

### Default RPC Registration

Previously, `@itwin/core-electron` and `@itwin/core-mobile` automatically registered the following RPCs on your behalf:

- IModelReadRpcInterface
- IModelTileRpcInterface
- SnapshotIModelRpcInterface
- PresentationRpcInterface

To be more aligned with our approach on Web and to prevent unnecessary registrations and coupling of dependencies, we are now requiring the consumer to register all RPCs they need on their end. Please refer to the documentation for [ElectronApp.startup]($core-electron) and [MobileHost.startup]($core-mobile).

### Breaking out of lockstep

To move more quickly and release independently, the following packages have broken out of lockstep with iTwin.js Core and have moved outside of the itwinjs-core repository.

#### AppUI

The source code for the following packages was moved to the new [AppUi repository](https://github.com/iTwin/appui).

- @itwin/appui-react
- @itwin/appui-layout-react
- @itwin/components-react
- @itwin/core-react
- @itwin/imodel-components-react

#### Presentation

The source code for the following packages was moved to the new [Presentation repository](https://github.com/iTwin/presentation).

- @itwin/presentation-components
- @itwin/presentation-opentelemetry
- @itwin/presentation-testing

#### Transformation

The transformer package `@itwin/core-transformer` was renamed to [`@itwin/imodel-transformer`](https://github.com/iTwin/imodel-transformer) and has its own repository now with supporting packages.

#### eslint-plugin

`@itwin/eslint-plugin` has moved to the [eslint-plugin repository](https://github.com/iTwin/eslint-plugin).

#### map-layers

`@itwin/map-layers` has moved into the [viewer-components-react repository](https://github.com/iTwin/viewer-components-react/tree/master/packages/itwin/map-layers).

### Deprecated API removals

The following previously-deprecated APIs have been removed:

**@itwin/core-backend**:

- `AliCloudStorageService`
- `AliCloudStorageServiceCredentials`
- `AzureBlobStorage`
- `CloudStorageService`
- `CloudStorageTileUploader`
- `CloudStorageUploadOptions`
- `tileCacheService` property of [IModelHost]($backend), [IModelHostOptions]($backend), and [IModelHostConfiguration]($backend)
- `IModelHost.tileUploader`

**@itwin/core-common**:

- `CloudStorageCache`
- `CloudStorageContainerDescriptor`
- `CloudStorageContainerUrl`
- `CloudStorageProvider`
- `CloudStorageTileCache`
- `IModelTileRpcInterface.getTileCacheContainerUrl`
- `IModelTileRpcInterface.isUsingExternalTileCache`

**@itwin/presentation-common**

- `ContentInstancesOfSpecificClassesSpecification.handlePropertiesPolymorphically`

### Deprecated API replacements

#### Querying ECSql

[ECSqlReader]($common) can be used as an AsyncIterableIterator. This makes migrating from using `query` to using `createQueryReader` much easier.
Both of these are methods that exist in [IModelDb]($backend), [ECDb]($backend), and [IModelConnection]($frontend).

`createQueryReader` can now be used as shown below:

```ts
for await (const row of iModel.createQueryReader("SELECT * FROM bis.Element")) {
  const rowId = row[0]; // or 'row.id'
}
```

It is important to note that the object returned by `createQueryReader` is a [QueryRowProxy]($common) object and _not_ a raw JavaScript object. To get a raw JavaScript object (as would have been assumed previously when using `query`), call `.toRow()` on the [QueryRowProxy]($common) object.

```ts
for await (const row of iModel.createQueryReader("SELECT * FROM bis.Element")) {
  const jsRow = row.toRow();
}
```

### Interfaces changed

#### @itwin/core-quantity

- The interface `UnitConversion` has been renamed to [UnitConversionProps]($quantity).

#### @itwin/ecschema-metadata

- The `FormatProps` interface has been replaced with the [SchemaItemFormatProps]($ecschema-metadata) type alias.
- The `UnitProps` interface has been renamed to [SchemaItemUnitProps]($ecschema-metadata).
- [ISchemaLocater.getSchema]($ecschema-metadata) and [ISchemaLocater.getSchemaSync]($ecschema-metadata) now take a `Readonly<SchemaKey>` instead of a [SchemaKey]($ecschema-metadata) and the [SchemaContext]($ecschema-metadata) parameter is no longer optional.

## Backend

### BackendHubAccess

BackendHubAccess has been marked @internal from @beta. The 'hubAccess' property on [IModelHostConfiguration]($core-backend) has also been marked @internal from @beta.

### Entity.getReferenceIds

[Entity.getReferenceIds]($core-backend) no longer returns a set of [Id64String]($core-bentley), but an [EntityReferenceSet]($core-common), because it now supports returning references
of entities that aren't elements.

## Geometry

### Mesh offset

The new static method [PolyfaceQuery.cloneOffset]($core-geometry) creates a mesh with facets offset by a given distance. The image below illustrates the basic concepts.

![Offset Example 1](./assets/cloneOffsetMeshBoxes.png "Original box mesh, offset box, and chamfered offset box")

At left is the original box, size 3 x 5 in the large face and 2 deep. The middle is constructed by `cloneOffset` with offset of 0.15 and default options. Note that it maintains the original sharp corners. The right box is constructed with [OffsetMeshOptions.chamferAngleBetweenNormals]($core-geometry) of 80 degrees. This specifies that when the original angle between normals of adjacent facets exceeds 80 degrees the corner should be chamfered, creating the slender chamfer faces along the edges and the triangles at the vertices. The default 120 degree chamfer threshold encourages corners to be extended to intersection rather than chamfered.

The image below illustrates results with a more complex cross section.

![Offset Example 2](./assets/cloneOffsetMeshExample2.png "Offset with sharp corners and with chamfers.")

The lower left is the original (smaller, inside) mesh with the (transparent) offset mesh around it with all sharp corners. At upper right the offset has chamfers, again due to setting the `chamferAngleBetweenNormals` to 120 degrees.

### Mesh intersection with ray

New functionality computes the intersection(s) of a [Ray3d]($core-geometry) with a [Polyface]($core-geometry). By default, [PolyfaceQuery.intersectRay3d]($core-geometry) returns a [FacetLocationDetail]($core-geometry) for the first found facet that intersects the infinite line parameterized by the ray. A callback can be specified in the optional [FacetIntersectOptions]($core-geometry) parameter to customize intersection processing, e.g., to filter and collect multiple intersections. Other options control whether to populate the returned detail with interpolated auxiliary vertex data: normals, uv parameters, colors, and/or the barycentric scale factors used to interpolate such data.

There is also new support for intersecting a `Ray3d` with a triangle or a polygon. [BarycentricTriangle.intersectRay3d]($core-geometry) and [BarycentricTriangle.intersectSegment]($core-geometry) return a [TriangleLocationDetail]($core-geometry) for the intersection point of the plane of the triangle with the infinite line parameterized by a ray or segment. Similarly, [PolygonOps.intersectRay3d]($core-geometry) returns a [PolygonLocationDetail]($core-geometry) for the intersection point in the plane of the polygon. Both returned detail objects contain properties classifying where the intersection point lies with respect to the triangle/polygon, including `isInsideOrOn` and closest edge data.

A new method [Ray3d.intersectionWithTriangle]($core-geometry) is also added which is 2-3 times faster than [BarycentricTriangle.intersectRay3d]($core-geometry). This new method only returns the intersection coordinates of the ray and triangle and no extra data.

### Abstract base class [Plane3d]($core-geometry)

A new abstract base class [Plane3d]($core-geometry) is defined to provide shared queries and enforce method names in multiple classes that act as 3D "planes" with various representations.

- The following classes now declare that they _extend_ [Plane3d]($core-geometry):
  - [Plane3dByOriginAndUnitNormal]($core-geometry) extends [Plane3d]($core-geometry)
  - [Plane3dByOriginAndVectors]($core-geometry) extends [Plane3d]($core-geometry)
  - [Point4d]($core-geometry) extends [Plane3d]($core-geometry)
  - [ClipPlane]($core-geometry) extends [Plane3d]($core-geometry)

This will provide more consistency and functionality than previously provided by the _interface_ [PlaneAltitudeEvaluator]($core-geometry).   API compatibility with the weaker [PlaneAltitudeEvaluator]($core-geometry) is maintained as follows:

- The abstract base class [Plane3d]($core-geometry) declares that it implements the [PlaneAltitudeEvaluator]($core-geometry).
- Classes that _extend_ [Plane3d]($core-geometry) inherit the _extended_ declaration of the base class (compatibility "by interface name").
- Classes that _extend_ [Plane3d]($core-geometry) inherit the various _abstract_ method obligations and (non-abstract) method implementations from the base class (compatibility "by collected list of methods").

With these changes the [PlaneAltitudeEvaluator]($core-geometry) can be deprecated.

### Intersect local ranges

A new method [ClipUtilities.doLocalRangesIntersect]($core-geometry) is added for determining whether two [Range3d]($core-geometry) objects in different local coordinates clash. This method performs an intersection of the ranges in the same coordinate system, _without_ expanding their volumes, as can happen when a `Range3d` is rotated. An optional `margin` signed distance can be used to shrink or expand the second range before the intersection, allowing for proximity testing. This can be used, for example, to efficiently test whether two elements in an iModel are approximately within 50cm of each other:

```ts
  // first element data, e.g. from iModel query
  const range0 = Range3d.create(Point3d.fromJSON(el.bBoxLow), Point3d.fromJSON(el.bBoxHigh));
  const placement0 = Placement3d.fromJSON({ origin: el.origin, angles: { pitch: el.pitch, roll: el.roll, yaw: el.yaw } });
  // [...] second element data similarly
  const isClash = ClipUtilities.doLocalRangesIntersect(range0, placement0.transform, range1, placement1.transform, 0.5);
```

## Display

### glTF bounding boxes

The existing [readGltfGraphics]($frontend) function returns an opaque [RenderGraphic]($frontend). A new [readGltf]($frontend) function has been added that produces a [GltfGraphic]($frontend) that - in addition to the `RenderGraphic` - includes the bounding boxes of the glTF model in local and world coordinates.

### Atmospheric Scattering

A physics-based Atmospheric Scattering effect is now available for the rendering system.

![Globe View of Atmospheric Scattering](.\assets\atmosphere_globe.jpg)

This effect can be toggled via [Environment.displayAtmosphere]($common) and adjusted through [Environment.atmosphere]($common).
It is also reactive to the sun's position defined at [DisplayStyle3dSettings.lights]($common).

The effect is only displayed with 3d geolocated iModels with [DisplayStyleSettings.backgroundMap]($common) set to a backgroundMap with [BackgroundMapSettings.globeMode]($common) equal to [GlobeMode.Ellipsoid]($common).

### Constant LOD mapping mode

Constant level-of-detail ("LOD") mapping mode is a technique that dynamically calculates texture cordinates to keep the texture near a certain size on the screen, thus preserving the level of detail no matter what the zoom level. It blends from one size of the texture to another as the view is zoomed in or out so that the change is smooth.

You can create a [RenderMaterial]($common) that uses this mode on the frontend via [RenderSystem.createRenderMaterial]($frontend) by setting `useConstantLod` to `true` in [MaterialTextureMappingProps]($frontend) and optionally specifying its parameters via `constantLodProps` (see [TextureMapping.ConstantLodParamProps]($common)).

You can also have a normal map use constant LOD mapping by setting `useConstantLod` in its properties via [MaterialTextureMappingProps.normalMapParams]($frontend) in your [CreateRenderMaterialArgs.textureMapping]($frontend). It is thus possible to have a pattern map which uses constant lod mapping and a normal map which uses some other texture mapping mode or visa versa.

To create a [RenderMaterialElement]($backend) with a constant LOD pattern map on the backend, use [RenderMaterialElement.insert]($backend) or [RenderMaterialElement.create]($backend). Pass in a `patternMap` with a [TextureMapProps]($common) which has `pattern_useConstantLod` set to true and optionally specify any or all of the `pattern_constantLod_*` properties.

To create a [RenderMaterialElement]($backend) with a constant LOD normal map on the backend, use [RenderMaterialElement.insert]($backend) or [RenderMaterialElement.create]($backend). Pass the normal map in [RenderMaterialElementParams.normalMap]($backend) and turn on the `useConstantLod` flag in its `NormalFlags` property.

The image below illustrates the effects of constant LOD mapping.

![Constant LOD mapping zoomin](./assets/ConstantLod.gif "Zooming in on comstant lod mapped texture. Note how detail fades out and is replaced by smaller detail as you zoom in.")     ![Constant LOD mapping](./assets/ConstantLod.jpg "view of constant lod mapping looking across surface")

## Presentation

### Active unit system

[PresentationManager]($presentation-frontend) has a way to set active unit system either through props when initializing ([PresentationManagerProps.activeUnitSystem]($presentation-frontend)) or directly through a setter ([PresentationManager.activeUnitSystem]($presentation-frontend)). Both of these ways have been deprecated in favor of using [QuantityFormatter.activeUnitSystem]($core-frontend) (access `QuantityFormatter` through `IModelApp.quantityFormatter`) to avoid asking consumers set the active unit system in two places. For the time being, while we keep the deprecated unit system setters on the presentation manager, they act as an override to [QuantityFormatter.activeUnitSystem]($core-frontend), but the latter is now used by default, so setting active unit system on presentation manager is not necessary any more.

### Hierarchy level filtering and limiting

Two new features have been made available to help working with very large hierarchies - hierarchy level filtering and limiting. Filtering was already available since `3.6` and has been promoted to `@beta`, limiting has been newly added as `@beta`. See [hierarchy filtering and limiting page](../presentation/hierarchies/FilteringLimiting.md) for more details.

### Stopped "eating" errors on the frontend

The [PresentationManager]($presentation-frontend) used to "eat" errors and return default value instead of re-throwing and exposing them to consumers. This made it impossible for consumer code to know that an error occurred, which could cause it to make wrong decisions. The decision has been re-considered and now Presentation manager lets consumers catch the errors. This affects the following APIs:

- [PresentationManager.getNodes]($presentation-frontend)
- [PresentationManager.getNodesAndCount]($presentation-frontend)
- [PresentationManager.getContent]($presentation-frontend)
- [PresentationManager.getContentAndSize]($presentation-frontend)
- [PresentationManager.getPagedDistinctValues]($presentation-frontend)
- [PresentationManager.getDisplayLabelDefinitions]($presentation-frontend)

Consumers of these APIs should make sure they're wrapped with try/catch blocks and the errors are handled appropriately. See our [error handling page](../presentation/advanced/ErrorHandling.md) for more details.

### Handling of long-running requests

The timeouts' strategy used for Presentation RPC has been changed.

Previously, the backend would return a "timeout" status if creating the response took more than 90 seconds (or as configured through [PresentationPropsBase.requestTimeout]($presentation-backend)). The frontend, upon receiving such a status, would repeat the request 5 times before propagating the timeout to the requestor on the frontend. This means that changing the timeout on the backend affects how long in total the frontend waits. By default that was 5 times 90 seconds, so 7.5 minutes in total.

Now, the two timeout configs on the backend and the frontend have been separated. The timeout on the frontend is set through [PresentationManagerProps.requestTimeout]($presentation-frontend) and defaults to 10 minutes. Presentation manager will repeat the RPC request as many times as needed to wait at least 10 minutes until returning the "timeout" response to the requestor. With this change the timeout configuration on the backend becomes less important as it merely affects how often the frontend will have to repeat the request. It can still be changed through [PresentationPropsBase.requestTimeout]($presentation-backend), but the default value has been reduced to 5 seconds.

### Use content modifiers on nested content

Previously, the [calculated](../presentation/content/ContentModifier.md#attribute-calculatedproperties) and [related properties](../presentation/content/ContentModifier.md#attribute-relatedproperties) defined in [content modifiers](../presentation/content/ContentModifier.md) were only applied on directly loaded instances' content. Occasionally, there is a need to request calculated and/or related properties to be loaded for specific instances in all situations, no matter if their content is loaded directly or indirectly. Previously that was only possible by chaining [related properties](../presentation/content/ContentModifier.md#attribute-relatedproperties) and [nested related properties](../presentation/content/RelatedPropertiesSpecification.md#attribute-nestedrelatedproperties) attributes. Now the content modifier rule has an attribute [`applyOnNestedContent`](../presentation/content/ContentModifier.md#attribute-applyonnestedcontent) which indicates if the modifier should be used on nested content. This removes the need to have duplicate [related properties specifications](../presentation/content/RelatedPropertiesSpecification.md) in those situations.

### Dependency updates

In addition to upgrading iTwin.js core dependencies to `4.0`, there are some other notable upgrades:

- Support for React 18 (keep support of React 17 too).
- Upgrade [iTwinUI](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI) from v1 to v2.
- `@itwin/presentation-backend`, `@itwin/presentation-common` and `@itwin/presentation-frontend` have new peer dependency `@itwin/ecschema-metadata`.

### ContentInstancesOfSpecificClassesSpecification

The deprecated field `handleInstancesPolymorphically` of [ContentInstancesOfSpecificClassesSpecification]($presentation-common) has been removed. To specify handling polymorphically, specify the value in `classes.arePolymorphic` or `excludedClasses.arePolymorphic`.

## Schemas

### Asynchronous schema loading

Added proper support for loading multiple schemas asynchronously and the ability to get information about a schema that is partially loaded.

```ts
const context = new SchemaContext();
const locater = new SchemaXmlFileLocater();
locater.addSchemaSearchPath("/Users/me/schemas/");
context.addLocater(locater);

const schemaKey = new SchemaKey("MySchemaWithManyReferences", 1, 0, 42);

// Start loading the schema but return as soon as we have loaded the name and version of the schema and it's references
const schemaInfo = await context.getSchemaInfo(schemaKey, SchemaMatchType.Exact);
// Get the whole schema either awaiting the schema promise created by getSchemaInfo or start loading if not already started
const schema = await context.getSchema(schemaKey, SchemaMatchType.Exact);
// Await the schema promise created by getSchemaInfo or return undefined if not already started
const schema2 = await context.getCachedSchema(schemaKey, SchemaMatchType.Exact);
```

### Other minor API changes

- Added `SchemaInfo` interface with schema keys for a schema and it's references.  `Schema` implicitly supports this interface.
- Some beta components had breaking changes and were moved to internal:
  - `SchemaGraph`
    - Now supports working with a `SchemaInfo` and a `SchemaContext` necessitating the init be made async.
  - `SchemaMap`
    - Use `Array<Schema>` in its place.
  - `SchemaCache`
    - Updated to support caching partially loaded schemas, use `SchemaContext` to cache schemas in it's place.
- Added helper method `SchemaFileUtility.writeSchemaToXmlString` to write schema xml to a string
- Added `Schema.startLoadingFromJson` to partially load a schema and return as soon as the `SchemaInfo` could be loaded.
