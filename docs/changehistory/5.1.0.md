## Electron 36 and 37 support

In addition to [already supported Electron versions](../learning/SupportedPlatforms.md#electron), iTwin.js now supports [Electron 36](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/electron-36-0) and [Electron 37](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/electron-37-0).

## Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles support

iTwin.js now supports displaying Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles via the new `Google3dTilesProvider`. See [this article](../learning/frontend/GooglePhotorealistic3dTiles.md) for more details.

## Station formatting enhancements

Available in `@itwin/core-quantity`, station formatting now supports a new `stationBaseFactor` property in [FormatProps]($quantity) to provide greater flexibility in station offset calculations. This property works in conjunction with the existing `stationOffsetSize` property to determine the effective station offset using the formula: `effective offset = stationBaseFactor * 10^stationOffsetSize`.

The `stationBaseFactor` property allows for non-standard station intervals that aren't simple powers of 10. The default value is 1, which maintains backward compatibility with existing station formats.

> __Note__: The `stationBaseFactor` property is currently implemented as an iTwin.js-specific extension and is not supported in the native EC (Entity Context) layer. This feature will eventually be incorporated into the ECFormat specification to provide broader compatibility across the iTwin ecosystem.

### Examples

| stationOffsetSize | stationBaseFactor | Value  | Effective Offset | Formatted |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------ | ---------------- | --------- |
| 2                 | 1                 | 1055.5 | 100              | 10+55.50  |
| 2                 | 5                 | 1055.5 | 500              | 2+55.50   |
| 3                 | 2                 | 1055.5 | 2000             | 0+1055.50 |

This enhancement enables more flexible station formatting for applications that require custom station intervals, such as specialized surveying or engineering workflows.

## Coordinate KindOfQuantity support

The [QuantityFormatter]($frontend) now supports the `AecUnits.LENGTH_COORDINATE` KindOfQuantity for coordinate formatting. This provides better schema integration and consistency with other iTwin applications when formatting coordinate values.

The default [QuantityTypeFormatsProvider]($frontend) has been updated to include format properties for `AecUnits.LENGTH_COORDINATE`, ensuring coordinate formatting is available out of the box without requiring additional schema configuration.

Previously, coordinate formatting was only available through `QuantityType.Coordinate`. With this enhancement, applications can now use the KindOfQuantity-based approach:

```ts
// Using KindOfQuantity for coordinate formatting
const formatSpec = IModelApp.quantityFormatter.getSpecsByName("AecUnits.LENGTH_COORDINATE");
if (formatSpec) {
  const formattedCoordinate = IModelApp.quantityFormatter.formatQuantity(coordinateValue, formatSpec.formatterSpec);
}
```

This change aligns with the broader migration from `QuantityType` enum values to KindOfQuantity-based formatting, providing:

- Schema-based format definitions that can be customized per iModel
- Consistent formatting behavior across iTwin applications
- Better integration with the FormatsProvider system

For migration guidance, see the [Quantity Formatting documentation](../learning/frontend/QuantityFormatting.md#migration-from-quantitytype-to-kindofquantity).

## Text changes and styling

### Persisting text

[TextAnnotation2d]($backend) and [TextAnnotation3d]($backend) now use the new BIS property `textAnnotationData` to persist the [TextAnnotation]($common) instead of storing it in the `jsonProperties`. You should still use `setAnnotation` and `getAnnotation` to interact with the persisted [TextAnnotation]($common).

### Drawing scale

Producing geometry for a [TextAnnotation]($common) inside of a [Drawing]($backend) now automatically scales the text by the `Drawing.scaleFactor`.

### Styling text

[AnnotationTextStyle]($backend) is a new class enabling [TextStyleSettings]($common) to be persisted in the iModel. It replaces the TextStyle class which is now removed.

[TextBlock]($common)s, [Paragraph]($common)s, and [Run]($common)s no longer refer to a persisted style by name. Instead, [TextBlock]($common)s refer to an [AnnotationTextStyle]($backend) by ID. [Paragraph]($common)s and [Run]($common)s can only provide style overrides.

[TextFrameStyleProps]($common) and [TextLeaderStyleProps]($common) are now part of [TextStyleSettings]($common)s. [TextAnnotationLeader]($common)s can only specify style overrides.

Text styling is now inherited by child [TextBlockComponent]($common)s. That means each style property overridden or inherited by the parent is also applied to the child, unless the child explicitly provides its own override for that property. [TextAnnotationLeader]($common)s are a special case. They are children of [TextAnnotation]($common)s. So are [TextBlock]($common)s. Leaders inherit their default styling from the [AnnotationTextStyle]($backend) specified by their sibling [TextBlock]($common). Use the [TextStyleResolver]($backend) class to resolve the effective style of TextBlockComponents and Leaders, taking into account overrides/style of the instance and its parent(s)/sibling.

## API deprecations

### @itwin/presentation-common

- `UnitSystemFormat`, `FormatsMap` and `KoqPropertyValueFormatter` constructor using the latter type have been deprecated. Instead, the constructor overload with "props" object should be used. The props object allows passing an optional `FormatsProvider` to use for finding formatting props for different types of values. When not specified, the `SchemaFormatsProvider` is used by default, so the behavior stays the same as before. Ideally, it's expected that frontend apps will pass `IModelApp.formatsProvider` for this prop.

### @itwin/presentation-backend

- The `PresentationManagerProps.schemaContextProvider` property has been deprecated. Starting with `5.0` release, `SchemaContext` is always available on [IModelDb]($core-backend), so this prop is no longer needed. If supplied, it will still be preferred over the iModel's schema context, until the property is removed completely in a future release.
- The `PresentationManagerProps.defaultFormats` property has been deprecated in favor of the new `formatsProvider` property.

### @itwin/presentation-frontend

- The `PresentationManagerProps.schemaContextProvider` property has been deprecated. Starting with `5.0` release, `SchemaContext` is always available on [IModelConnection]($core-frontend), so this prop is no longer needed. If supplied, it will still be preferred over the iModel's schema context, until the property is removed completely in a future release.
- The `PresentationManagerProps.defaultFormats` property has been deprecated in favor of the `FormatsProvider` now being available on [IModelApp.formatsProvider]($core-frontend).

## Schedule Script Editing Mode

[DisplayStyle3dState]($frontend) now offers an interactive editing mode for [RenderSchedule.Script]($common)s, allowing interactive, dynamic modification of the style's schedule script with immediate visual feedback. Previously, every modification of the script would trigger a refresh of all of the graphics; the new mode instead draws temporary graphics just for the elements affected by the script changes.

Use [DisplayStyle3dState.setScheduleEditing]($frontend) to enter this mode, or to update the script again after entering the mode. Once all edits are complete, call [DisplayStyle3dState.commitScheduleEditing]($frontend) to finalize the changes a trigger a full refresh of the graphics. Example:

```ts
[[include:ScheduleScript_editingMode]]
```
