# 2.6.0 Change Notes

## Addition of @bentley/telemetry-client

The new `@bentley/telemetry-client` package has been added as an abstraction layer to support different types of telemetry on both the frontend and backend.

This package is now **required** to be installed when depending on `@bentley/imodeljs-backend` or `@bentley/imodeljs-frontend` as it has been added as a peerDependency of both packages.

## ESLint plugin

The ESLint configuration was moved from `@bentley/build-tools` to a new ESLint plugin `@bentley/eslint-plugin`. The ESLint configuration in package.json should now look like:

```json
"scripts": {
  "lint": "eslint ./src/**/*.{ts,tsx} 1>&2",
},
"devDependencies": {
  "eslint": "^6.8.0",
  "bentley/eslint-plugin": "^2.6.0",
  ...
},
"eslintConfig": {
  "plugins": [
    "@bentley",
    ...
    ],
  "extends": "plugin:@bentley/imodeljs-recommended"
}
```

Alternatively, `plugin:@bentley/ui` can be used, it extends the recommended configuration with additional rules used in core ui packages. There may be more alternative configurations in the future.

The old configuration path `@bentley/build-tools/.eslintrc.js` remains in place but it's not recommended to use it.

## Electron Security enhancements

To reduce security risks when running under Electron, this version now runs with `nodeIntegration=false`, `contextIsoloation=true`, and `sandbox=true`. To understand the rationale and implications of these changes, please see the [Electron Security Checklist]( https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/security#checklist-security-recommendations). Note that these choices are the defaults, but can be overriden by arguments to `ElectronManger.initialize`. If you previously passed `webPreferences` arguments to that function, it is best to remove them entirely and rely on the default values.
