## Geometry

### Clip any curve

The new method [ClipUtilities.clipAnyCurve]($core-geometry) clips the input curve or region. One just needs to pass an [AnyCurve]($core-geometry) and a [Clipper]($core-geometry), and the method returns the clipped curves or regions that lie inside the clipper.

### Drape region onto mesh

The new method [PolyfaceClip.drapeRegion]($core-geometry) computes the portion of the input [Polyface]($core-geometry) that lies inside the clipper generated by sweeping the input [AnyRegion]($core-geometry) along a direction. For example, the red polygon below is swept downward onto the white mesh, and the green mesh is returned:

## Electron 26 support

In addition to [already supported Electron versions](../learning/SupportedPlatforms.md#electron), iTwin.js now supports [Electron 26](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/electron-26-0).

## Locating and serializing schemas

New APIs like [SchemaLoader]($ecschema-metadata) allow you to [locate schemas](../learning/serializing-xml-schemas.md/#schemas-from-an-imodel) in the context of an iModel.
You can serialize schemas using the new functions [SchemaXml.writeFile]($ecschema-locaters) and [SchemaXml.writeString]($ecschema-locaters).
