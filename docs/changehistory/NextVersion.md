# NextVersion

## Updated version of Electron

Updated recommended version of Electron from 10.1.3 to 11.1.0. Note that Electron is specified as a peer dependency in iModel.js - so it's recommended but not mandatory that applications migrate to this electron version.

## IpcSocket for use with dedicated backends

For cases where a frontend and backend are explicitly paired (e.g. desktop and mobile apps), a more direct communication path is now supported via the [IpcSocket api]($docs/learning/IpcInterface.md). See the [Rpc vs Ipc learning article]($docs/learning/RpcVsIpc.md) for more details.

## Breaking API Changes

### Electron Initialization

The `@beta` API's for desktop applications to use Electron via the `@bentley/electron-manager` package have been simplified substantially. Existing code will need to be adjusted to work with this version. The class `ElectronManager` has been removed, and it is now replaced with the classes [ElectronBackend]($electron-manager) and [ElectronFrontend]($electron-manager).

To create an Electron application, you should initialize your frontend via:

```ts
  import { ElectronFrontend } from "@bentley/electron-manager/lib/ElectronFrontend";
  ElectronFrontend.initialize({ rpcInterfaces });
```

And your backend via:

```ts
  import { ElectronBackend } from "@bentley/electron-manager/lib/ElectronBackend";
  ElectronBackend.initialize({ rpcInterfaces });
```

> Note that the class `ElectronRpcManager` is now initialized internally by the calls above, and you do not need to initialize it directly.
