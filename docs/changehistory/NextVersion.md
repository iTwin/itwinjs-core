## Electron versions support

In addition to the already supported Electron 14, Electron versions 15, 16, and 17 are now supported (blog posts for Electron versions [15](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/electron-15-0), [16](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/electron-16-0), [17](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/electron-17-0)). At the moment, support for Electron 18 and 19 is blocked due to a bug in the V8 javascript engine (for more information see [Issue #35043](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/35043)).
