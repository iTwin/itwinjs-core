## Viewport.zoomToElements improvements

[Viewport.zoomToElements]($frontend) accepts any number of element Ids and fits the viewport to the union of their [Placement]($common)s. A handful of shortcomings of the previous implementation have been addressed:

* Previously, the element Ids were passed to [IModelConnection.Elements.getProps]($frontend), which returned **all** of the element's properties (potentially many megabytes of data), only to extract the [PlacementProps]($common) for each element and discard the rest. Now, it uses the new [IModelConnection.Elements.getPlacements]($frontend) function to query only the placements.
* Previously, if a mix of 2d and 3d elements were specified, the viewport would attempt to union their 2d and 3d placements, typically causing it to fit incorrectly because 2d elements reside in a different coordinate space than 3d elements. Now, the viewport ignores 2d elements if it is viewing a 3d view, and vice-versa.
