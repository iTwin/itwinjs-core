## GPU memory limits

The [RenderGraphic]($frontend)s used to represent a [Tile]($frontend)'s contents consume WebGL resources - chiefly, GPU memory. If the amount of GPU memory consumed exceeds that available, the WebGL context will be lost, causing an error dialog to be displayed and all rendering to cease. The [TileAdmin]($frontend) can now be configured with a strategy for managing the amount of GPU memory consumed and avoiding context loss. Each strategy defines a maximum amount of GPU memory permitted to be allocated to tile graphics; when that limit is exceeded, graphics for tiles that are not currently being displayed by any [Viewport]($frontend) are discarded one by one until the limit is satisfied or no more tiles remain to be discarded. Graphics are discarded in order from least-recently- to most-recently-displayed, and graphics currently being displayed will not be discarded. The available strategies are:

- "default" - a "reasonable" amount of GPU memory can be consumed.
- "aggressive" - a conservative amount of GPU memory can be consumed.
- "relaxed" - a generous amount of GPU memory can be consumed.
- "none" - an unbounded amount of GPU memory can be consumed - no maximum is imposed.

The precise amount of memory permitted by each strategy varies based on whether or not the client is running on a mobile device; see [TileAdmin.mobileGpuMemoryLimits]($frontend) and [TileAdmin.nonMobileGpuMemoryLimits]($frontend) for precise values. The application can also specify an exact amount in number of bytes instead.

The limit defaults to "default" for mobile devices and "none" for non-mobile devices. To configure the limit when calling [IModelApp.startup]($frontend), specify [TileAdmin.Props.gpuMemoryLimits]($frontend). For example:

```ts
  IModelApp.startup({ tileAdmin: TileAdmin.create({ gpuMemoryLimits: "aggressive" }) });
```

Separate limits for mobile and non-mobile devices can be specified at startup if desired; the appropriate limit will be selected based on the type of device the client is running on:

```ts
  IModelApp.startup({ tileAdmin: TileAdmin.create({
    gpuMemoryLimits: {
      mobile: "default",
      nonMobile: "relaxed",
    }),
  });
```

To adjust the limit after startup, assign to [TileAdmin.gpuMemoryLimit]($frontend).

This feature replaces the `@alpha` `TileAdmin.Props.mobileExpirationMemoryThreshold` option.

## IModelHost and IModelApp Initialization Changes

Initialization processing of iModel.js applications, and in particular the order of individual steps for frontend and backend classes has been complicated and vague, involving several steps that vary depending on application type and platform. This release attempts to clarify and simplify that process, while maintaining backwards compatibility. In general, if your code uses [IModelHost.startup]($backend) and [IModelApp.startup]($frontend) for web visualization, it will continue to work without changes. However, for native (desktop and mobile) apps, some refactoring may be necessary. See [IModelHost documentation]($docs/learning/backend/IModelHost.md) for appropriate backend initialization, and [IModelApp documentation]($docs/learning/frontend/IModelApp.md) for frontend initialization.

The `@beta` API's for desktop applications to use Electron via the `@bentley/electron-manager` package have been simplified substantially. Existing code will need to be adjusted to work with this version. The class `ElectronManager` has been removed, and it is now replaced with the classes `ElectronHost` and `ElectronApp`.

To create an Electron application, you should initialize your frontend via:

```ts
  import { ElectronApp } from "@bentley/electron-manager/lib/ElectronFrontend";
  ...
  await ElectronApp.startup();
```

And your backend via:

```ts
  import { ElectronHost } from "@bentley/electron-manager/lib/ElectronBackend";
  ...
  await ElectronHost.startup();
```

Likewise, to create an iOS application, you should initialize your frontend via:

```ts
  import { IOSApp } from "@bentley/mobile-manager/lib/MobileFrontend";
  ...
  await IOSApp.startup();
```

And your backend via:

```ts
  import { IOSHost } from "@bentley/mobile-manager/lib/MobileBackend";
  ...
  await IOSHost.startup();
```

Both frontend and backend `startup` methods take optional arguments to customize the App/Host environments.

## ProcessDetector API

It is frequently necessary to detect the type of JavaScript process currently executing. Previously, there were several ways (sometimes redundant, sometimes conflicting) to do that, depending on the subsystem being used. This release attempts to centralize process classification into the class [ProcessDetector]($bentley) in the `@bentleyjs-core` package. All previous methods for detecting process type have been deprecated in favor of `ProcessDetector`. The deprecated methods will likely be removed in version 3.0.

## Common table expression support in ECSQL

CTE are now supported in ECSQL. For more information read [Common Table Expression](..\learning\CommonTableExp.md)

## Breaking Api Changes

### Quantity package

The alpha interface `ParseResult` has changed to `QuantityParserResult` which can either be a `ParseQuantityError` or a `ParsedQuantity`.
New static type guards `Parser.isParsedQuantity` and `Parser.isParseError` can be used to coerce the result into the appropriate type.

### IModelHostConfiguration.applicationType

The type of the internal member `IModelHostConfiguration.applicationType` had a redundant declaration in `IModelHost.ts`. It is now correctly declared to be of type `IModelJsNative.ApplicationType`. The names of the members were the same, so this will not likely cause problems.
