## ColorDef validation

[ColorDef.fromString]($common) returns [ColorDef.black]($common) if the input is not a valid color string. [ColorDef.create]($common) coerces the input numeric representation into a 32-bit unsigned integer. In either case, this occurs silently. Now, you can use [ColorDef.isValidColor]($common) to determine if your input is valid.

## ColorByName is an object, not an enum

Enums in TypeScript have some shortcomings, one of which resulted in a bug that caused [ColorDef.fromString]($common) to return [ColorDef.black]($common) for some valid color strings like "aqua". This is due to several standard color names ("aqua" and "cyan", "magenta" and "fuschia", and several "grey" vs "gray" variations) having the same numeric values. To address this, [ColorByName]($common) has been converted from an `enum` to a `namespace`. Code that accesses `ColorByName` members by name will continue to compile with no change.
