### Compressed 3D assets

The data within [glTF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlTF) assets - including those delivered by [3D tilesets](https://github.com/CesiumGS/3d-tiles) - can optionally be compressed using two different methods: [draco compression](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_draco_mesh_compression/README.md) and [meshopt compression](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/main/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_meshopt_compression). Both methods can significantly reduce the file size (and therefore download time) of an asset. iTwin.js already supports Draco compression, but that method only applies to triangle meshes. Meshopt compression works for many other kinds of data, including point clouds.

Now, meshopt compression is supported. You can use a library like [meshoptimizer](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer) to compress 3D assets using this technique.
