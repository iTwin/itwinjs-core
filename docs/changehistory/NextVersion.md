### `IModelConnection.createQueryReader` now terminates gracefully if the connection is closed

Previously, if an [IModelConnection]($frontend) was closed between the call to [IModelConnection.createQueryReader]($frontend) and the first iteration of its results, it ended up throwing during the underlying RPC call.

The `IModelConnection.createQueryReader` executor now checks [IModelConnection.isOpen]($frontend) before attempting any RPC call. If the connection is already closed at the time of the first or any subsequent read, the reader terminates immediately with no rows. No error is thrown.

Callers that previously relied on a thrown error to detect connection closure should check `imodel.isOpen` before or after iteration instead.

**Example**

```typescript
const reader = imodel.createQueryReader("SELECT ECInstanceId FROM bis.Element");
await imodel.close(); // connection closes before iteration
const rows = await reader.toArray(); // used to throw, now returns an empty array
```

### Quantity property description classes deprecated

The quantity property description classes [LengthDescription]($frontend), [SurveyLengthDescription]($frontend), [EngineeringLengthDescription]($frontend), [AngleDescription]($frontend), and their [FormattedQuantityDescription]($frontend) base class are now deprecated.

These appui-based helpers were introduced when quantity formatting was driven by `QuantityType`, but new quantity formatting work should use `kindOfQuantityName`-based APIs through [IModelApp.quantityFormatter]($frontend) and [FormatSpecHandle]($quantity) instead.

For existing tool settings and other appui-based property flows, these deprecated classes remain available as a compatibility path while the editor stack moves toward deriving quantity formatting and parsing from property metadata such as `kindOfQuantityName`.

The deprecated classes remain behavior-compatible and will not be removed before a future major release.

## @itwin/map-layers-formats

### Azure Maps basemap support is available through map-layers-formats

`@itwin/map-layers-formats` now registers Azure Maps imagery support through `MapLayersFormats.initialize()` and exposes a beta `AzureMaps` helper for applying Azure Maps Street, Aerial, and Hybrid basemaps.

Applications configure the Azure Maps key when initializing `@itwin/map-layers-formats` with `MapLayersFormats.initialize({ azureMapsOpts: { subscriptionKey: ... } })`. After initializing `@itwin/map-layers-formats`, code that wants Azure-specific basemap helpers can import `AzureMaps` from that package.
