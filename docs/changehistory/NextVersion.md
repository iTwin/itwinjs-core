## Electron 36 support

In addition to [already supported Electron versions](../learning/SupportedPlatforms.md#electron), iTwin.js now supports [Electron 36](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/electron-36-0).

## API deprecations

### @itwin/presentation-backend

- The `PresentationManagerProps.schemaContextProvider` property has been deprecated. Starting with `5.0` release, `SchemaContext` is always available on [IModelDb]($core-backend), so this prop is no longer needed. If supplied, it will still be preferred over the iModel's schema context, until the property is removed completely in a future release.

### @itwin/presentation-frontend

- The `PresentationManagerProps.schemaContextProvider` property has been deprecated. Starting with `5.0` release, `SchemaContext` is always available on [IModelConnection]($core-frontend), so this prop is no longer needed. If supplied, it will still be preferred over the iModel's schema context, until the property is removed completely in a future release.
