## Electron versions support

In addition to the already supported Electron 14, Electron versions 15, 16, and 17 are now supported. At the moment, support for Electron 18 and 19 is blocked due to a bug in the V8 javascript engine (for more information see [Issue #35043](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/35043)).
