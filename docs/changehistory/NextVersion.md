## [@bentley/ecschema-metadata](https://www.itwinjs.org/reference/ecschema-metadata/) changes

Test - To reduce the size and limit the scope of the APIs available in the ecschema-metadata package, all APIs associated with EC Schema editing and validation have been moved to the [@bentley/ecschema-editing](https://www.itwinjs.org/reference/ecschema-editing/) package. This includes all source code under the [Validation](https://www.itwinjs.org/reference/ecschema-metadata/) and [Editing](https://www.itwinjs.org/reference/ecschema-metadata/editing/) folders. All corresponding @beta types defined in the ecschema-metadata package have been deprecated.  All @alpha types have been removed from the ecschema-metadata package.
