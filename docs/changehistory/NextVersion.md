### Opt-in fallback for missing navigation relationship class ids

Added `ECSQLOPTIONS NAV_REL_CLASSID_FALLBACK` for legacy navigation properties that contain an `Id` but no `RelECClassId`. When enabled, end-table relationship queries and `ECVLib.Relations()` report the relationship declared by the navigation property. Existing behavior is unchanged when the option is omitted, and directly selecting the navigation property's `RelECClassId` still returns its stored `NULL` value.

The option adds compatibility predicates that can result in less efficient query plans, so applications should enable it only for queries that need to read affected legacy data. `ECVLib.Relations()` also requires `ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES`.

The ECSQL version was bumped to `2.0.4.2`.
