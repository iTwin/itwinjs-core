## Display system

### Dropped WebGL 1 support

Web browsers display 3d graphics using an API called [WebGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL), which comes in 2 versions: WebGL 1, released 11 years ago; and WebGL 2, released 6 years ago. WebGL 2 provides many more capabilities than WebGL 1. Because some browsers (chiefly Safari) did not provide support for WebGL 2, iTwin.js has maintained support for both versions, which imposed some limitations on the features and efficiency of its rendering system.

Over a year ago, support for WebGL 2 finally became [available in all major browsers](https://www.khronos.org/blog/webgl-2-achieves-pervasive-support-from-all-major-web-browsers). iTwin.js now **requires** WebGL 2 - WebGL 1 is no longer supported. This change will have no effect on most users, other than to improve their graphics performance. However, users of iOS will need to make sure they have upgraded to iOS 15 or newer to take advantage of WebGL 2 (along with the many other benefits of keeping their operating system up to date).

[IModelApp.queryRenderCompatibility]($frontend) will now produce [WebGLRenderCompatibilityStatus.CannotCreateContext]($webgl-compatibility) for a client that does not support WebGL 2.
