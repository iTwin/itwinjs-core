## Selection set

There are two similar selection-related concepts in `@itwin/core-frontend` - [SelectionSet]($core-frontend) and [HiliteSet]($core-frontend). The former is generally used by interactive tools (e.g. the "Move element" tool), so it contains what tools think is selected. The latter is used by the graphics system to know what elements to highlight, so it contains what users think is selected. Generally, we want the two sets to be in sync to avoid confusion why tools act on different elements than what users think are selected. Keeping them in sync was not always possible, because `HiliteSet` may store Model and SubCategory ids, but `SelectionSet` could only store Element ids. So we could end up in situations where a Model id is added to `HiliteSet` and `SelectionSet` is empty, making users think that all elements in that model are selected, but tools not knowing anything about it.

To alleviate this problem, the `SelectionSet`-related APIs have been enhanced to support storing Model and SubCategory ids, similar to what `HiliteSet` does. The change has been made in a backwards compatible way, so all existing code using `SelectionSet` should continue to work as before:

- `SelectionSet` modification methods `add`, `addAndRemove`, `remove`, `replace` now, in addition to existing `Id64Arg` argument, accept the `SelectableIds` structure.
- `SelectionSetEvent` attributes `added` and `removed` have been deprecated, but continue to work as before, containing only element ids. In addition, the event object now contains new `additions` and `removals` attributes, which are instances of `SelectableIds` and contain all ids that were added or removed from the selection set, including those of Model and SubCategory.

Because the `SelectionSet` now stores additional types of ids, existing code that listens to `onChange` event may start getting extra invocations that don't affect the element selection (e.g. `SelectAddEvent` with `added: []` and `additions: { models: ["0x1"] }`). Also, the `isActive` getter may return `true` even though `elements` set is empty.

## API deprecations

### @itwin/core-frontend

- Deprecated [SelectionSet]($core-frontend)-related APIs:

  - `SelectionSet.has` and `SelectionSet.isSelected` - use `SelectionSet.elements.has(id)` instead.
  - `SelectionSetEvent.added` and `SelectionSetEvent.removed` - use `SelectionSetEvent.additions.elements` and `SelectionSetEvent.removals.elements` instead.

- Deprecated [HiliteSet.setHilite]($core-frontend) - use `add`, `remove`, `replace` methods instead.

### @itwin/presentation-common

- All public methods of [PresentationRpcInterface]($presentation-common) have been deprecated. Going forward, RPC interfaces should not be called directly. Public wrappers such as [PresentationManager]($presentation-frontend) should be used instead.

## Breaking Changes

### Opening connection to local snapshot requires IPC

[SnapshotConnection.openFile]($frontend) now requires applications to have set up a valid IPC communication. If you're using this API in an Electron or Mobile application, no additional action is needed as long as you call `ElectronHost.startup` or `MobileHost.startup` respectively. This API shouldn't be used in Web applications, so it has no replacement there.

### Updated minimum requirements

A new major release of iTwin.js affords us the opportunity to update our requirements to continue to provide modern, secure, and rich libraries. Please visit our [Supported Platforms](../learning/SupportedPlatforms) documentation for a full breakdown.

#### Node.js

Node 18 will reach [end-of-life](https://github.com/nodejs/release?tab=readme-ov-file#release-schedule) soon and will no longer be supported. iTwin.js 5.0 requires a minimum of Node 20.9.0, though we recommend using the latest long-term-support version.

#### Electron

iTwin.js now supports only the latest Electron release (Electron 33) and has dropped support for all older Electron releases. This decision was made because Electron releases major updates much more frequently than iTwin.js and it is difficult to support a high number of major versions.

### Deprecated API removals

The following previously-deprecated APIs have been removed:

#### @itwin/appui-abstract

| Removed                     | Replacement |
| --------------------------- | ----------- |
| `EditorPosition.columnSpan` | N/A         |

#### @itwin/core-electron

| Removed                             | Replacement                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ElectronApp.callDialog`            | [ElectronApp.dialogIpc]($electron)                        |
| `ElectronHost.getWindowSizeSetting` | [ElectronHost.getWindowSizeAndPositionSetting]($electron) |

### Packages dropped

As of iTwin.js 5.0, the following packages have been removed and are no longer available:

| Removed                        | Replacement                                               |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@itwin/core-webpack-tools`    | We no longer recommend using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and instead recommend using [Vite](https://vite.dev/). |
| `@itwin/backend-webpack-tools` | We no longer recommend webpack-ing backends, which was previously recommended to shrink the size of backends. |
