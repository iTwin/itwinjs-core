## Workspaces

The `beta` [Workspace]($backend) and [Settings]($backend) APIs have been updated to make them easier to use, including the addition of the [WorkspaceEditor]($backend) API for creating new [WorkspaceDb]($backend)s to hold workspace resources. Consult the [learning article]($docs/learning/backend/Workspace) for a comprehensive overview with examples.
