## Workspaces

The `beta` [Workspace]($backend) and [Settings]($backend) APIs have been updated to make them easier to use, including the addition of the [WorkspaceEditor]($backend) API for creating new [WorkspaceDb]($backend)s to hold workspace resources. Consult the [learning article](../learning/backend/Workspace) for a comprehensive overview with examples.

## Electron 31 support

In addition to [already supported Electron versions](../learning/SupportedPlatforms.md#electron), iTwin.js now supports [Electron 31](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/electron-31-0).
