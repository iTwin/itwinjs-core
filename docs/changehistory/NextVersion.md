## @itwin/core-frontend

### Configurable precision for graphical editing at high coordinates

During a [GraphicalEditingScope]($frontend), graphics for modified elements that are georeferenced far from the coordinate system origin could exhibit float32 precision artifacts such as jagged curves. The new [GraphicalEditingScope.dynamicGraphicsAbsolutePositionThreshold]($frontend) property sets the world-space coordinate magnitude (in meters) beyond which such graphics use `rtcCenter` centering to preserve precision, at a small performance cost. It defaults to 10 kilometers. Set it before making edits, as it is read once per model when that model's first element is modified.

```ts
const scope = await briefcase.enterEditingScope();
scope.dynamicGraphicsAbsolutePositionThreshold = 50_000;
```

### `IModelConnection.createQueryReader` now terminates gracefully if the connection is closed

Previously, if an [IModelConnection]($frontend) was closed between the call to [IModelConnection.createQueryReader]($frontend) and the first iteration of its results, it ended up throwing during the underlying RPC call.

The `IModelConnection.createQueryReader` executor now checks [IModelConnection.isOpen]($frontend) before attempting any RPC call. If the connection is already closed at the time of the first or any subsequent read, the reader terminates immediately with no rows. No error is thrown.

Callers that previously relied on a thrown error to detect connection closure should check `imodel.isOpen` before or after iteration instead.

**Example**

```typescript
const reader = imodel.createQueryReader("SELECT ECInstanceId FROM bis.Element");
await imodel.close(); // connection closes before iteration
const rows = await reader.toArray(); // used to throw, now returns an empty array
```

## @itwin/map-layers-formats

### Azure Maps basemap support is available through map-layers-formats

`@itwin/map-layers-formats` now registers Azure Maps imagery support through `MapLayersFormats.initialize()` and exposes a beta `AzureMaps` helper for applying Azure Maps Street, Aerial, and Hybrid basemaps.

Applications configure the Azure Maps key when initializing `@itwin/map-layers-formats` with `MapLayersFormats.initialize({ azureMapsOpts: { subscriptionKey: ... } })`. After initializing `@itwin/map-layers-formats`, code that wants Azure-specific basemap helpers can import `AzureMaps` from that package.
