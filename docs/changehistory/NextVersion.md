## Ambient Occlusion Improvements

The ambient occlusion effect has undergone some quality improvements.

Changes:

- The shadows cast by ambient occlusion will decrease in size the more distant the geometry is.
- The maximum distance for applying ambient occlusion now defaults to 10,000 meters instead of 100 meters.
- The effect will now fade as it approaches the maximum distance.

Old effect, as shown below:

![AO effect is the same strength in the near distance and far distance](./assets/AOOldDistance.png)

New effect, shown below:

![AO effect fades in the distance; shadows decrease in size](./assets/AONewDistance.png)

For more details, see the new descriptions of the `texelStepSize` and `maxDistance` properties of [AmbientOcclusion.Props]($common).

## Transformer API

The synchronous `void`-returning overload of [IModelTransformer.initFromExternalSourceAspects]($transformer) has been deprecated.
It will still perform the old behavior synchronously until it is removed. It will now however return a `Promise` (which should be
awaited) if invoked with the an [InitFromExternalSourceAspectsArgs]($transformer) argument, which is necessary when processing
changes instead of the full source contents.

## Presentation

### Restoring Presentation tree state

It is now possible to restore previously saved Presentation tree state on component mount.

```ts
// Save current tree state
const { nodeLoader } = usePresentationTreeNodeLoader(args);
useEffect(() => exampleStoreTreeModel(nodeLoader.modelSource.getModel()), []);

// Restore tree state on component mount
const seedTreeModel = exampleRetrieveStoredTreeModel();
const { nodeLoader } = usePresentationTreeNodeLoader({ ...args, seedTreeModel });
```

### OpenTelemetry

It is now possible to setup OpenTelemetry reporting using `PresentationManagerProps.diagnosticsCallback` attribute.

Example usage:

```ts
import { OTLPTraceExporter } from "@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-grpc";
import { context, trace } from "@opentelemetry/api";
import { convertToReadableSpans } from "@itwin/presentation-opentelemetry";
import { Presentation } from "@itwin/presentation-backend";

const traceExporter = new OTLPTraceExporter({
  url: "<OpenTelemetry collector's url>",
});

Presentation.initialize({ diagnosticsCallback: (diagnostics) => {
  const parentSpanContext = trace.getSpan(context.active())?.spanContext();
  const spans = convertToReadableSpans(diagnostics, parentSpanContext);
  traceExporter.export(spans, () => {});
} });
```

### Localization Changes

Previously, some of the data produced by the Presentation library was being localized both on the backend. This behavior was dropped in favor of localizing everything on the frontend. As a result, the requirement to supply localization assets with the backend is also removed.

In case of a backend-only application, localization may be setup by providing a [localization function when initializing the Presentation backend](../presentation/advanced/Localization.md).  By default the library localizes known strings to English.

**Deprecated APIs:**

- PresentationManagerProps.localeDirectories
- PresentationManagerProps.defaultLocale
- PresentationManager.activeLocale

## IModelSchemaLoader replaced with SchemaLoader

Replaced `IModelSchemaLoader` with `SchemaLoader` class and function to get schemas from an iModel. This allows us to remove the ecschema-metadata dependency in core-backend.

```typescript
// Old
import { IModelSchemaLoader } from "@itwin/core-backend";
const loader = new IModelSchemaLoader(iModel);
const schema = loader.getSchema("BisCore");

// New
import { SchemaLoader } from "@itwin/ecschema-metadata";
const loader = new SchemaLoader((name) => iModel.getSchemaProps(name); );
const schema = loader.getSchema("BisCore");
```

The new `SchemaLoader` can be constructed with any function that returns [ECSchemaProps]($common) when passed a schema name string.

## Electron versions support

In addition to the already supported Electron 14, Electron versions 15, 16, and 17 are now supported (blog posts for Electron versions [15](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/electron-15-0), [16](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/electron-16-0), [17](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/electron-17-0)). At the moment, support for Electron 18 and 19 is blocked due to a bug in the V8 javascript engine (for more information see [Issue #35043](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/35043)).

## Geometry

### Coplanar facet consolidation

A new method, [PolyfaceQuery.cloneWithMaximalPlanarFacets]($core-geometry), can identify groups of adjacent coplanar facets in a mesh and produce a new mesh in which each group is consolidated into a single facet. The consolidated facets are necessarily not triangular and various bridge edges will be present in non-convex facets.

![maximalPlanarFacets](assets/Geometry-maximalPlanarFacets.png "Mesh with many coplanar facets; new mesh with consolidation of coplanar facets")

### Filling mesh holes

A new method, [PolyfaceQuery.fillSimpleHoles]($core-geometry), can identify holes in a mesh and produce a new mesh in which some or all of the holes are replaced with facets. Which holes are filled can be controlled using [HoleFillOptions]($core-geometry) to specify constraints such as maximum hole perimeter, number of edges, and/or loop direction.

## Deprecations

### @itwin/core-geometry

`BoxProps.origin` has been replaced with `BoxProps.baseOrigin` to align with the "box" JSON format.

## SELECT * FROM Link Tables

Previously when we did SELECT * on a link table, it would only return ECInstanceId, ECClassId, SourceECInstanceId and TargetECInstanceId. We were skipping SourceECClassId and TargetECClassId. This behavior was dropped as technically SELECT * on a link table should also return SourceECClassId and TargetECClassId.
The new behavior is that we would return ECInstanceId, ECClassId, SourceECInstanceId, SourceECClassId, TargetECInstanceId, TargetECClassId when we do SELECT * on a link table.
