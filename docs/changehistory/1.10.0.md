# 1.10.0 Change Notes

## View transition animations

iModel.js will now perform smooth animations when changing between saved views, if possible. If the beginning and ending views are in the same direction but far apart, a *zoom out then in* path is followed to provide context. See [ScreenViewport.animation](https://www.imodeljs.org/v1/reference/imodeljs-frontend/views/screenviewport/animation) for settings that control view animations.

[Viewport.synchWithView](https://www.imodeljs.org/v1/reference/imodeljs-frontend/views/viewport/synchwithview) previously accepted a `boolean` argument indicating whether or not the changes should be saved in the undo buffer. It now alternatively accepts a [ViewChangeOptions](https://www.imodeljs.org/v1/reference/imodeljs-frontend/views/viewchangeoptions) allowing further customization of its behavior, including whether and how to animate the transition.

## IModel Transformation and Data Exchange

[IModelExporter](https://www.imodeljs.org/v1/reference/imodeljs-backend/imodels/imodelexporter), [IModelTransformer](https://www.imodeljs.org/v1/reference/imodeljs-backend/imodels/imodeltransformer), and [IModelImporter](https://www.imodeljs.org/v1/reference/imodeljs-backend/imodels/imodelimporter) are now beta and provide low-level functionality needed for iModel transformation and data exchange.
See the [iModel Transformation and Data Exchange]($docs/learning/backend/IModelTransformation.md) article for more information.

## High-DPI display support

Beta support for [device pixel ratio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/devicePixelRatio) was introduced in v1.9.0. 1.10.0 fixes a handful of bugs associated with this feature. In particular, device pixel ratio may vary between different [Viewport](https://www.imodeljs.org/v1/reference/imodeljs-frontend/views/viewport)s. As a result, the previously free-standing APIs have moved to the [Viewport](https://www.imodeljs.org/v1/reference/imodeljs-frontend/views/viewport) class:

- [Viewport.devicePixelRatio](https://www.imodeljs.org/v1/reference/imodeljs-frontend/views/viewport/devicepixelratio) replaces `queryDevicePixelRatio`.
- [Viewport.cssPixelsToDevicePixels](https://www.imodeljs.org/v1/reference/imodeljs-frontend/views/viewport/csspixelstodevicepixels) replaces `cssPixelsToDevicePixels`.

Do not assume that `Viewport.devicePixelRatio` will always return [`window.devicePixelRatio`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/devicePixelRatio).

## Viewing tools

- New walk tool [LookAndMoveTool](https://www.imodeljs.org/v1/reference/imodeljs-frontend/tools/lookandmovetool).
  - Supports mouse look and keyboard (wasd) for movement.
  - Touch screen control sticks for look and move.
- Improved responsiveness when using touch controls.

## Visualization

- Reduced CPU overhead associated with binding uniform shader program variables, resulting in up to 30% improvement in frames per second.
- Graphics for reality models and background maps load much more quickly and smoothly.

## Geometry

### Matrix3d inverse state bug fix

- BUG: matrix times matrix multipliers (multiplyMatrixMatrix, multiplyMatrixMatrixInverse, multiplyMatrixInverseMatrix, multiplyMatrixMatrixTranspose, multiplyMatrixTransposeMatrix) did not transfer inverse coefficient arrays into the product.
- When an existing result matrix marked "inverseStored" was supplied, the "inverseStored" marking persisted, but the product inverse coefficient matrix was not constructed
- When no result was supplied in the call, there were no problems.
- As corrected, all 5 multiplications construct inverse products when possible, and mark up appropriately.

### `CurveCurve.intersectionPairsXY` returns details of line-line and arc-arc coincident geometry

- `CurveLocationDetail` data carrier has new optional members
  - `fraction1` = fractional position for end of coincident section
  - `point` = point at end of coincident section
  - `detail.captureFraction1Point1 (f,xyz)` directly captures (no clone) fraction and point.
  - CurveLocationDetail.createCurveEvaluatedFractionFraction` constructor with 2 fractions.
  - `detail.inverseInterpolateFraction (f, defaultLocalFraction)` maps input fraction f to local fraction of the `fraction, fraction1` interval of the detail.
  - `detail.swapFractionsAndPoints ()` swaps the `[fraction,point]` and `[fraction1, point1]` values (if both defined)

### Miscellaneous

- New `Arc3d` method `arc.scaleAboutCenterInPlace (scaleFactor);`
- New `Matrix3d` method `matrixA.multiplyMatrixInverseMatrix(other: Matrix3d, result?: Matrix3d): Matrix3d | undefined`
- New `Segment1d` method `segment.clampDirectedTo01(): boolean;`
  - intersect with [0,1] interval
  - maintain current direction
    - return false if empty after clip.
  - New `Segment1d` method `segment.`reverseIfNeededForDeltaSign(sign?: number): void;`
    - maintain endpoints, but reverse so direction corresponds to request.
