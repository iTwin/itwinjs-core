# 1.11.0 Change Notes

## TypeScript 3.7.4

iModel.js now compiles with [TypeScript 3.7.2](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-7.html). Aside from keeping current, the primary motivations for the upgrade include [uncalled function checks](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-7.html#uncalled-function-checks) and [assertion functions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-7.html#assertion-functions).

[assert](https://www.imodeljs.org/v1/reference/bentleyjs-core/utils/assert) is now an [assertion function](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-7.html#assertion-functions). This assures the compiler that code following a call to `assert` will never execute unless the asserted condition is true. Bear in mind that because calls to `assert` are stripped out of production builds, this assurance is only true in development builds - so reserve use of `assert` for conditions that are truly never expected to occur, and use ordinary validation and exception handling for other conditions.

## api-extractor 7.7.3

Upgrading to TypeScript 3.7.2 necessitated an upgrade to a new version of [api-extractor](https://api-extractor.com/), primarily due to changes to the JavaScript emitted by tsc for property getters and setters. api-extractor now requires that documentation and release tags are applied only to the *getter*, never the *setter*. This imposes some constraints which were temporarily relaxed in api-extractor 3.6:

- Write-only properties (having only a setter, no getter) are rejected.
- A setter cannot have a different release tag than the corresponding getter.

## Module documentation

Upgrading to TypeScript 3.7.2 necessitated an upgrade to [typedoc 0.15.1](https://typedoc.org/) and v2.1.0 of the [typedoc plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typedoc-plugin-external-module-name) used to support external module declarations. This changes the format of `@module` comments.

Previous syntax for `@module` comments:

```ts
/** @module ModuleName */
```

New syntax for `@module` comments:

```ts
/** @packageDocumentation
 * @module ModuleName
 */
```

Without the `@packageDocumentation`, the documentation generator will fail to recognize that the source file should be mapped to the `ModuleName` external module.

## Geometry

- new public methods in RegionOps:
  - RegionOps.sortOuterAndHoleLoopsXY
  - apply parity logic to determine containment of holes in parents (or holes in islands)
  - RegionOps.constructAllXYRegionLoops
    - Compute intersections among unstructured input curves
    - Construct areas bounded by those inputs.
  - RegionOps.curveArrayRange
    - construct range of unstructured array of curves.
  - RegionOps.expandLineStrings
    - In an array of curve primitives, replace each LineString3d with expansion to LineSegment3d
- (new method) CurveCurve.allIntersectionsAmongPrimitivesXY
  - Supporting changes in CurveCurveIntersectionXY context class.
- CurveLocationDetail
  - new method to ask if fraction1 is present (i.e. this is an interval rather than single point.
- Make implementations of CurvePrimitive and CurveCollection methods to collect leaf primitives and strokes more consistent:
  - collectCurvePrimitives method
    - new optional args for (a) preallocated collector, (b) controlling expansion of CurveChainWithDistanceIndex
    - public entry RegionOps.collectCurvePrimitives
    - internal entries in CurveCollection, CurvePrimitive
    - internal "Go" methods in: CurveChainWithDistanceIndex,
  - CurveChain.cloneStroked is abstract (implemented by Path, Loop, CurveChainWithDistanceIndex
- CurveFactory
  - New method to create xy rectangles with optional fillets.
