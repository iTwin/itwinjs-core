# Terms with Specific Semantic Meaning

The list below contains terms that have specific semantic meaning and we need to ensure that when they are being used, they convey the correctly meaning. E.g. We need to ensure that the class authors know when to use EquipmentSet rather than EquipmentGroup or EquipmentList.

This definition of the semantic meaning will be captured in the BIS Thesaurus. The list below is to enumerate some of the special terms.
