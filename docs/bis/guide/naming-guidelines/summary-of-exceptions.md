# Summary of Exceptions

The list below contains a summary of all exception.

| Description |
|-------------|
| The use of 1d, 2d and 3d needs special mention.|
| The section [Use abbreviations and acronyms with care](#Use_abbreviations_and_acronyms_with_care) states that two-letter acronyms must have both letters capitalized provided that each letter represents a different word. E.g. UI (“Use Interface”) and IO (“Input/Output”) but Db (because the word is Database and not Data Base). 1d is short for One Dimensional – which is two words and should really be abbreviated to OD or 1D.|
|The rule [Names may not start with a number](#Names_may_not_start_with_a_number) states that we cannot start with 1d, 2d and 3d. And lastly [Use numbers with care](#Use_numbers_with_care) states that we should try and avoid numbers entirely.|
|The rule [When combining terms, arrange them in increasing order of significance](#When_combining_terms_arrange_them_in_in) suggest that 2dDrawing should be used rather than Drawing2d – but this would break the previous rule.|
|So when it comes to 1d, 2d, 3d; only use them after another term and always as lowercase ‘d’.|
|Never use the words OneDimensional, TwoDimensional or ThreeDimensional even if it appears to be more consistent.|
|Class names [should use the singular form](#Use_singular_form); except for relationships – where we want [the relationship name to indicate the cardinality](#Relationship_name_should_indicate_cardin).|
