## About this Repository

[![Build status](https://dev.azure.com/imodeljs/imodeljs/_apis/build/status/iModel.js)](https://dev.azure.com/imodeljs/imodeljs/_build/latest?definitionId=12)

This repository is a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) that holds the source code to multiple iTwin.js npm packages. It is built using [Rush](http://rushjs.io/).

See [rush.json](./rush.json) for the complete list of packages and [Versioning.md](./Versioning.md) for package and API versioning policies.

Each package has its own **node_modules** directory that contains symbolic links to _common_ dependencies managed by Rush.

## Features

- ✅ Create infrastructure digital twins of assets or projects
- ✅ Aggregate Engineering Models, Reality Data, Geographic Information Systems, Internet of Things (IoT) Data, and other standard formats
- ✅ Visualize data and engineering changes in 3D and 4D
- ✅ Analyze data to gain insights and drive new business outcomes across multiple platforms

## Quick Start

- This is a [sample](https://www.itwinjs.org/sandboxes/iTwinPlatform/3d%20Viewer) of an iTwin viewer - a frontend application that displays infrastructure projects on browsers. It uses many of the APIs and libraries published from this repository.
- You can also look at [other samples](https://developer.bentley.com/samples/) which showcases the capabilities of iTwin.js, and the iTwin Platform.

## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/): an installation of the latest security patch of Node 20. The Node installation also includes the **npm** package manager.
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/): our required package manager. It is more performant and monorepo friendly than `npm`. We recommend installing `pnpm` using [`corepack enable pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-corepack). Note you may have to use an administrator shell to run the command.
- [Rush](https://github.com/Microsoft/web-build-tools/wiki/Rush): to install `npm install -g @microsoft/rush`
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): this is listed as a devDependency, so if you're building it from source, you will get it with `rush install`.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): an optional dependency, but the repository structure is optimized for its use

> See [supported platforms](./docs/learning/SupportedPlatforms.md) for further information.
