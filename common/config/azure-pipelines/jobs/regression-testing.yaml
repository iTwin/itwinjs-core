# iModel.js Regression Testing Build
#
# Tests all supported versions of iModel.js on 3 main supported platforms; Windows 10, Ubuntu 10.04, and MacOS.
#
# Starts with the minimum version (currently 10.16.0) and then follows the tip of each subsequent minor version
#
# The current LTS is tested in all normal CI/PR builds so no need to test it here.
