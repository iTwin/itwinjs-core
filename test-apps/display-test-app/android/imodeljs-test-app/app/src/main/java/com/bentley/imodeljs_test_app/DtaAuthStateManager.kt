/* This code is based on the AppAuth-Android sample app code found here:
 * https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/app/java/net/openid/appauthdemo/AuthStateManager.java
 *
 * The following modifications were made:
 * - It was converted to Kotlin using Android Studio's automatic conversion process, then cleaned up.
 * - The unused updateAfterRegistration function was removed.
 * - The ITM prefix was added to various items.
 * - The constructor and getInstance were changed to take an ITMApplication instead of a Context.
 * - Added clear() and updated() functions.
 * - Added documentation comments.
 * - Added disableSharedPreferences functionality.
