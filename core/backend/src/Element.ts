/** Elements are the smallest individually identifiable building blocks for modeling the real world in an iModel.
 * Each element represents an entity in the real world. Sets of Elements (contained in [[Model]]s) are used to model
 * other Elements that represent larger scale real world entities. Using this recursive modeling strategy,
 * Elements can represent entities at any scale. Elements can represent physical things or abstract concepts
 * or simply be information records.
 *
 * Every Element has a 64-bit id (inherited from Entity) that uniquely identifies it within an iModel. Every Element also
 * has a "code" that identifies its meaning in the real world. Additionally, Elements may have a "federationGuid"
 * to hold a GUID, if the element was assigned that GUID by some other federated database. The iModel database enforces
 * uniqueness of id, code, and federationGuid.
