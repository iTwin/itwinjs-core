/** A Relationship indicating that one Element *drives* another Element.
 * An ElementDrivesElement relationship defines a one-way "driving" relationship from the source to the target.
 * When the source of an ElementDrivesElement relationship changes, the ElementDrivesElement itself can get a callback, and both the source and target elements can get callbacks.
 * By inserting ElementDrivesElement relationships, an app can create and store an acyclic directed graph of dependencies between elements.
 *
 * # Defining dependencies
 * Create an ElementDrivesElement relationship to specify that the source element drives the target element.
 * For example, to specify that element e1 drives element e2, create a relationship between them like this:
 * ```ts
 *  const ede = ElementDrivesElement.create(iModel, e1id, e2id);
 *  ede.insert();
 * ```
 * This creates a persistent relationship. The fact that e1 drives e2 is persisted in the iModel.
 *
 * # Defining dependency graphs
 * When you create multiple ElementDrivesElement relationships, you create a network of dependencies. The target of one may be the source of another.
 * A change in the content of an DgnElement can therefore trigger changes to many downstream elements.
 *
 * For example, to make element e1 drive element e2 and e2 drive another element, e3, create two relationships like this:
 * ```ts
 *  const ede12 = ElementDrivesElement.create(iModel, e1id, e2id);
 *  const ede23 = ElementDrivesElement.create(iModel, e2id, e3id);
 *  ede12.insert();
 *  ede23.insert();
 * ```
 * Those two relationships create this graph:
 * ```
 * e1 --> e2 --> e3
 * ```
 * Where the "-->" is meant to represent a driving relationship.
 *
 * The order in which you create the relationships does not matter.
 * The graph indicates that e3 depends on e2 and e2 depends on e1.
 *
 * An ElementDrivesElement relationship is between one source element and one target element.
 * Many ElementDrivesElement relationships can point to a given element, and many can point out of it.
 * Thus, you can define many:many relationships.
 * For example:
 * ```ts
 *  const ede12 = ElementDrivesElement.create(iModel, e1id, e2id);
 *  const ede112 = ElementDrivesElement.create(iModel, e11id, e2id);
 *  const ede23 = ElementDrivesElement.create(iModel, e2id, e3id);
 *  const ede231 = ElementDrivesElement.create(iModel, e2id, e31id);
 *  ede12.insert();
 *  ede112.insert();
 *  ede23.insert();
 *  ede231.insert();
 * ```
 * Creates this graph:
 * ```
 * e1        e3
 *    \    /
 *      e2
 *    /    \
 * e11       e31
 * ```
 * e2 depends on both e1 and e11. e2 then drives e3 and e31.
 *
 * In an ElementDrivesElement dependency graph, the relationships are the "edges" and the Elements are the "nodes".
 * The following terms are used when referring to the elements (nodes) in a dependency graph:
 * * Inputs - The sources of all edges that point to the element. This includes all upstream elements that flow into the element.
 * * Outputs - The targets of all edges that point out of the element. This includes all downstream elements.
 *
 * # Subgraph Processing
 * When changes are made, only the part of the overall graph that is affected will be processed. So, for example,
 * suppose we have this graph:
 * ```
 * e1 --> e2 --> e3
 * ```
 * If e1 changes, then the subgraph to be processed is equal to the full graph, as shown.
 *
 * If only e2 changes, then the subgraph to be processed is just:
 * ```
 *       e2 --> e3
 * ```
 * If only e3 changes, then the subgraph consists of e3 by itself.
 *
 * Returning to the second example above, suppose we have this graph:
 * ```
 * e1        e3
 *    \    /
 *      e2
 *    /    \
 * e11       e31
 * ```
 * If e1 is changed, the affected subgraph is:
 * ```
 * e1        e3
 *    \    /
 *      e2
 *         \
 *           e31
 * ```
 * If e2 is changed, the affected subgraph is:
 * ```
 *           e3
 *         /
 *      e2
 *         \
 *           e31
 * ```
 * # Callbacks
 * Once the affected subgraph to process is found, it propagates changes through it by making callbacks.
 * Classes for both elements (nodes) and ElementDrivesElements relationships (edges) can receive callbacks.
 *
 * ## ElementDrivesElement Callbacks
 * The following callbacks are invoked on ElementDrivesElement relationship classes (edges):
 * * onRootChanged
 * * onDeletedDependency
 *
 * Note that these are static methods. Their default implementations do nothing.
 * To receive and act on these callbacks, a domain should define a subclass of ElementDrivesElement and use that to create relationships.
 * The subclass should then implement the callbacks that it would like to act on.
 *
 * A ElementDrivesElement subclass callback is expected to make changes to the output element only!
 *
 * ## Element Callbacks
 * The following callbacks are invoked on Element classes (nodes):
 * * Element.onBeforeOutputsHandled
 * * Element.onAllInputsHandled
 *
 * ## Order
 * Callbacks are invoked by BriefcaseDb.saveChanges.
 * They are invoked in dependency (topological) order: driving elements first, then driven elements.
 *
 * Each callback is invoked only once. No matter how many times a given element was changed during the transaction,
 * a callback such as ElementDrivesElement.onRootChanged will be invoked only once.
 * In the same way, no matter how many of its inputs were changed, a callback such as Element.onAllInputsHandled will be
 * invoked only once.
 *
 * For example, suppose we have a graph:
 * ```
 * e1 --> e2 --> e3
 * ```
 *
 * Suppose that e1 is directly modified. No callbacks are made at that time.
 * Later, when BriefcaseDb.saveChanges is called, the following callbacks are made, in order:
 * 1. Element.onBeforeOutputsHandled e1
 * 1. ElementDrivesElement.onRootChanged e1->e2
 * 1. Element.onAllInputsHandled e2
 * 1. ElementDrivesElement.onRootChanged e2->e3
 * 1. Element.onAllInputsHandled e3
 *
 * Suppose that e3 is modified directly and BriefcaseDb.saveChanges is called.
 * Since no input to a relationship was changed, the sub-graph will be empty, and no callbacks will be made.
 *
 * Returning to the second example above, suppose we have this graph:
 * ```
 * e1        e3
 *    \    /
 *      e2
 *    /    \
 * e11       e31
 * ```
 * If e1 is changed and BriefcaseDb.saveChanges is called, the subgraph is:
 * ```
 * e1        e3
 *    \    /
 *      e2
 *         \
 *           e31
 * ```
 * The callbacks are:
 * 1. Element.onBeforeOutputsHandled e1
 * 1. ElementDrivesElement.onRootChanged e1->e2
 * 1. Element.onAllInputsHandled e2
 * 1. ElementDrivesElement.onRootChanged e2->e3
 * 1. Element.onAllInputsHandled e3
 * 1. ElementDrivesElement.onRootChanged e2->e31
 * 1. Element.onAllInputsHandled e31
 *
 * (The ElementDrivesElement.)
 *
 * #Errors
 * Circular dependencies are not permitted. If a cycle is detected, that is treated as a fatal error. All ElementDrivesElement relationships
 * involved in a cycle will have their status set to 1, indicating a failure.
 *
 * A callback may call txnManager.reportError to reject an invalid change. It can classify the error as fatal or just a warning.
 * A callback make set the status value of an ElementDrivesElement instance to 1 to indicate a processing failure in that edge.
 *
 * After BriefcaseDb.saveChanges is called, an app should check db.txns.validationErrors and db.txns.hasFatalError to find out if graph-evaluation failed.
