/** An RpcManager that uses RpcDefaultConfiguration/RpcDirectProtocol to make client stubs invoke
 * registered server impls as direct method calls within the same JavaScript context. In other words,
 * TestRpcManager sets up a protocol that uses our remoting mechanism but cuts out the communication
 * part of it. (No IPC or XHR is used or required.)
 * Nevertheless, all of the rest of the call marshalling and operation monitoring mechanism is used.
 * That makes TestRpcManager a way to write simple, single-process integration tests for frontends
 * and backends that actually use RpcInterfaces. Note that to write such a single-process integration
 * test, you must make *both* client and server use TestRpcManager to configure their RpcInterfaces.
 * It will not work if one side uses TestRpcManager and the other uses some other protocol (say, cloud).
 * That means that you must actually program the backend to know when it is running in direct test
 * mode and to employ TestRpcManager in that case.
