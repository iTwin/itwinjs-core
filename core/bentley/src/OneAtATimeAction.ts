 * request queue to grow such that the delay to service new requests is unbounded.
 *
 * With this class, we issue the initial request immediately. When the second request arrives before the first one completes, it becomes *pending*. If subsequent
 * requests arrive with a pending request, the current pending request is *abandoned* (its Promise is rejected) and the new request becomes pending.
 * When the active request completes, the pending request (if present) is started. In this manner there will only ever be one outstanding HTTP request for this type
 * of operation, but the first and last request will always eventually complete.
