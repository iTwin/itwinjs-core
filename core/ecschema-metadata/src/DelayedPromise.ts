/**
 * Similar to a normal Promise, a DelayedPromise represents the eventual completion (or failure)
 * and resulting value of an asynchronous operation ***that has not yet started***.
 *
 * The asynchronous operation behind a DelayedPromise will start when any of the following occurs:
 *  - The DelayedPromise is `await`ed.
 *  - A callback is attached via `.then()` or `.catch(() => { })`.
 *  - The asynchronous operation is explicitly started via `.start()`
 *
 * Just as normal Promises will never return to their pending state once fulfilled or rejected,
 * a DelayedPromise will never re-execute its asynchronous operation more than **once**.
 *
 * Ultimately, a DelayedPromise is nothing more than some syntactic sugar that allows you to
 * represent an (asynchronously) lazily-loaded value as an instance property instead of a method.
 * You could also accomplish something similar by defining an async function as a property getter.
 * However, since a property defined as a DelayedPromise will not start simply by being accessed,
 * additional (non-lazily-loaded) "nested" properties can be added.
 *
 * [!alert text="*Remember:* Unlike regular Promises in JavaScript, DelayedPromises represent processes that **may not** already be happening." kind="warning"]
