## Description

The __@itwin/frontend-devtools__ package contains various tools and widgets designed to help track information and diagnose issues related to the iTwin.js front-end display system. It is intended chiefly for use by developers.

Because this is a developer-only package, its functionality is not expected to ever be promoted from "beta" to "public".

## Contents

* /src/FrontendDevTools.ts - entry point for initializing the package.
* /src/ui/ - rudimentary basic html controls used to build the widgets.
* /src/tools/ - a collection of immediate-mode and interactive-mode tools. All of the tools' key-in strings begin with "fdt" (as in, "Front-end Dev Tools").
* /src/effects/ - a collection of screen-space post-processing effects that alter the image produced by a Viewport.
* /src/widgets/ - widgets that wrap some of the package's functionality into embeddable UI controls, including:
  * `KeyinField` - allows any tool to be executed by typing in its keyin string (with autocompletion).
  * `FpsTracker` - displays the average frames-per-second.
  * `TileStatisticsTracker` - displays the state of tile requests in the system.
  * `MemoryTracker` - displays statistics about GPU memory allocated by the display system.
  * `TileMemoryBreakdown` - breaks down GPU memory used by tiles based on their relationship to the set of displayed tiles.
  * `GpuProfiler` - displays GPU timing queries and allows recording for viewing in chrome://tracing. See <https://aras-p.info/blog/2017/01/23/Chrome-Tracing-as-Profiler-Frontend/> for more information.
  * `DiagnosticsPanel` - combines all of the above widgets into a single panel.

## Usage

The package must be initialized before use. This can be done when your application starts up, or deferred until first use of the package. The packages' tools will not be registered until the package is initialized.

Example of initializing at start-up:

```ts
  await IModelApp.startup();
  await FrontendDevTools.initialize();
```

An easy way to use this package is to instantiate a `DiagnosticsPanel`, supplying a `Viewport` for which the panel will supply diagnostics and tools.
You can then integrate the panel into your UI by appending its `element` HTMLElement to your DOM.

Alternatively, you can embed any configuration of the widgets into your DOM as you like.

Even if you use none of the widgets, initializing the package will make all of its tools available for use, ready to be associated with your own UI entry points or to be executed via key-in. The set of available key-ins can be found in /public/locales/en/FrontendDevTools.json.

## Key-ins

The following key-ins are delivered with this package. Each begins with the prefix `fdt`, short for "Front-end Dev Tools". Use `FrontendDevTools.initialize` to register them for use in your application.

### Toggle key-ins

The key-ins below enable, disable, or toggle a specific feature. They take at most one argument (case-insensitive):

* "on": Display the decoration.
* "off": Stop displaying the decoration.
* "toggle" or no arguments: Invert the current state.

* `fdt project extents` - Toggles display of a decoration illustrating the iModel's project extents.
* `fdt freeze scene` - Toggles scene freeze for the active viewport. While scene freeze is enabled, the same set of tiles will continue to be displayed until the scene is unfrozen - no new tiles will be loaded. Useful for zooming in or out to inspect geometry inside specific tiles.
* `fdt wiremesh` - Toggles the display of wiremesh overlay on surfaces in the selected viewport.
* `fdt section cut` - Specify whether a clip volume applied to the view should produce cut geometry at intersections with the design models. This controls `ViewState.details.clipStyle.produceCutGeometry`.
* `fdt particle snow` - Toggle a particle effect simulating snowfall for the active viewport.
* `fdt frustum selected` - Toggles a decoration representing the current frustum of the selected viewport. The decoration is displayed in any *other* open viewports - so if no other viewports are open, this key-in has no effect.
* `fdt shadow frustum` - Like `fdt frustum selected`, but visualizes the frustum used to select tiles for the shadow map (when shadows are enabled).
* `fdt frustum snapshot` - Toggles a decoration representing the current frustum of the active viewport. The decoration remains displayed until it is toggled back off. `fdt frustum selected` is much more useful, but requires at least two open viewports.  Including `fdt snapshot preload` will also display the preload frustum decoration.
* `fdt tooltips` - Toggles debugging tooltips for element locate. When enabled, hovering over an element will display a tooltip containing information like element ID, subcategory ID, and model ID.
* `fdt metric` - Toggles use of metric quantity formatting, e.g. as used to format output from the measure tools. Turning metric "off" switches to use of imperial units.
* `fdt fadeout` - Toggles "fade-out" transparency mode for the selected viewport.
* `fdt tile requests` - When enabled, displays in each viewport the bounding boxes of all tiles currently requested for loading by the viewport that was selected at the time the key-in was executed. Green boxes indicate pending requests; red indicate requests being actively processed.
* `fdt 3dmanip` - Change the `allow3dManipulations` flag for the 3d view associated with the active viewport.
* `fdt tiletree bounds` - When enabled, draws bounding boxes representing the volume of each tile tree displayed in the active viewport.
* `fdt toggle readpixels` - Toggles "read pixels" mode on the active viewport. In this mode, geometry is rendered to the screen as if it was being rendered off-screen for element locate purposes.
* `fdt dpi lod` - Toggles whether device pixel ratio should be taken into account when computing LOD for tiles and decoration graphics.
* `fdt attachments` - Toggles display of view attachments in the sheet view associated with the active viewport.
* `fdt attachment bounds` - Toggles display of bounding boxes around each view attachment in the active viewport.
* `fdt drawing graphics` - When enabled, 2d graphics in any drawing view will not be displayed. Useful for inspecting 3d graphics of attached section view, if any.
* `fdt sectiondrawing spatial view` - When enabled, 3d graphics for a section drawing will be displayed in the drawing view, even if they otherwise wouldn't be.
* `fdt toggle drapefrustum` - Toggles display of frustum that is used to drape classifiers and background map.
* `fdt toggle reality preload` - Toggles the display of preloaded reality tile bounding boxes.
* `fdt toggle reality freeze`  - Toggles the freezing of reality tile loading, when the reality tiles are frozen new reality tiles are not downloaded or purged.
* `fdt toggle reality logging` - Toggle the logging of reality tile loading and selection diagnostics to the console.
* `fdt toggle reality bounds` - Toggle the display of bounding boxes for reality tiles.
* `fdt set building display` Toggle the display of the worldwide OpenStreetMap worldwide buildingslayer by attaching or displaying as a reality model in the current viewport.  The OSM buildings are aggregated and supplied from Cesium Ion <https://cesium.com/content/cesium-osm-buildings/>. The first argument is required on|off - the second optional argument is a value for transparency between 0 and 1.
* `fdt wow ignore background` Toggle whether the background color needs to be white for white-on-white reversal to apply.

### Screen-space effect key-ins

This package supplies several examples of screen-space post-processing effects that alter the image presented by a Viewport, exposed via the following key-ins:

* `fdt effect add` - append the specified effect to the selected viewport's list of effects. Effects are applied in the order in which they appear in that list. Available effect names are:
  * "lensdistortion" - simulates the "fish-eye" distortion produced by real-world cameras with very wide fields of view.
  * "saturation" - adjusts the saturation of each pixel in the image.
  * "vignette" - applies a vignette effect.
  * "flip" - mostly useless except for demonstration purposes: flips the image horizontally and/or vertically, and/or inverts the color of each pixel.
  * Six "convolution kernel" effects that alter the image by blending neighboring pixels in different ways: "blur", "sharpen", "unsharpen", "emboss", "edgedetect", and "sharpness".
* `fdt effect clear` - remove all effects from the selected viewport.
* `fdt effect config saturation` - configure the saturation effect. Accepts one argument of the form `multiplier=x` where `x` is a floating point number by which to multiply each color's saturation. The default multiplier is 2.0.

### Planar Mask keyins

This package supplies several keyins to control planar masking for background maps and reality models. These masks provide a two and a half dimensional method for masking the regions where the background map, reality models and BIM geometry overlap.
Planar masks include an optional transparency override.  If a transparency values is specified, a value of 0 will completely mask the reality model  - the masked portion will be omitted completely, higher values will produce less masking and a semit translucent display of the masked geometry. If no transparency is included then the transparency value from the mask elements is used.  An additional argument boolean argument will invert the mask and mask the area outside the mask geometry rather than inside.

#### Background map planar masks

These keyins control the planar masking of the background map.

* `fdt set map mask by priority`  Set the background map to be masked based on priority.  Masking by priority will mask by higher priority models.  By default background map have lowest priorty (-2048) Unless their priority is overridden reality models are higher priority and BIM models are always higher priority, therefore if priority masking is selected then the background map will be masked by all reality and BIM models. A value for transparency may optionally be included.
  * `transparency`: (optional) - A value for the mask transparency override. [0...1]
  * `invert`: (optional) - If `on` or `true` then the mask sense is inverted and the area outside the mask geometry will be masked and the area inside the mask is displayed.
* `fdt set map mask elements` Set the background map to be masked by one or more elements.  If elements are already selected they are used for the mask, otherwise the mask elements may be selected individually.
  * `transparency`: (optional) - A value for the mask transparency override. [0...1]
  * `invert`: (optional) - If `on` or `true` then the mask sense is inverted and the area outside the mask geometry will be masked and the area inside the mask is displayed.
* `fdt set map mask exclude elements` Set the background map to be masked by all elements except the selected (or individually picked) excluded elements.
  * `transparency`: (optional) - A value for the mask transparency override. [0...1]
  * `invert`: (optional) - If `on` or `true` then the mask sense is inverted and the area outside the mask geometry will be masked and the area inside the mask is displayed.
* `fdt set map mask models` Set the background map to be masked by the selected models.  The selected models can come from either the current selection set or can be picked individually.
  * `transparency`: (optional) - A value for the mask transparency override. [0...1]
  * `invert`: (optional) - If `on` or `true` then the mask sense is inverted and the area outside the mask geometry will be masked and the area inside the mask is displayed.
* `fdt set map mask subcategory` Set the background map to be masked by one or more picked subcategories.
  * `transparency`: (optional) - A value for the mask transparency override. [0...1]
  * `invert`: (optional) - If `on` or `true` then the mask sense is inverted and the area outside the mask geometry will be masked and the area inside the mask is displayed.
* `fdt unmask map`  Removes the current background map masks.

#### Reality model planar masks

These keysins control the planar masking of reality models.

* `fdt set reality model mask by priority` Set the reality model to masked based on priority.  Masking by priority will cause the masked model to be masked by all higher priority models.  By default global reality models (such as the OpenStreetMap building layer) have a priority of -1024 and standard reality models have a priority of zero.  BIM models have a priority of 1024.  Therefore with default priorities reality models are always masked by BIM model and global reality models are masked by standard reality models.  By specifying a priority bias for the when creating the masks for a reality model the masking of reality models by other reality models can be controlled.
  * `transparency`: (optional) - A value for the mask transparency override. [0...1]
  * `priority`: (optional) - A bias to be applied to the default reality model priority.  As lower priority models are masked by higher priority ones, specifying a priority of -1 would cause the reality model to be masked by other reality models.
  * `invert`: (optional) - If `on` or `true` then the mask sense is inverted and the area outside the mask geometry will be masked and the area inside the mask is displayed.
* `fdt set reality model mask models`
  * `transparency`: (optional)- A value for the mask transparency override.  A value of 0 (the default) will completely mask the reality model, higher values will produce less masking and more more map display [0..1]  If no transparency is included then the transparency value from the mask elements is used.
  * `invert`: (optional) - If `on` or `true` then the mask sense is inverted and the area outside the mask geometry will be masked and the area inside the mask is displayed.
* `fdt set reality model mask elements` Set the reality model to be masked by one or more elements.  If elements are already selected they are used for the mask, otherwise the mask elements may be selected individually.
  * `transparency`: (optional) - A value for the mask transparency override. [0...1]
  * `invert`: (optional) - If `on` or `true` then the mask sense is inverted and the area outside the mask geometry will be masked and the area inside the mask is displayed.
* `fdt set reality model mask exclude elements` Set a reality model to be masked by all elements except the selected (or individually picked) excluded elements.
  * `transparency`: (optional) - A value for the mask transparency override. [0...1]
  * `invert`: (optional) - If `on` or `true` then the mask sense is inverted and the area outside the mask geometry will be masked and the area inside the mask is displayed.
* `fdt set reality model mask subcategory` Set a reality mdel to be masked by one or more picked subcategories.
  * `transparency`: (optional) - A value for the mask transparency override. [0...1]
  * `invert`: (optional) - If `on` or `true` then the mask sense is inverted and the area outside the mask geometry will be masked and the area inside the mask is displayed
* `fdt unmask reality model` Removes the masks from the selected reality model.

### Other key-ins

* `fdt save view` - Copies to the clipboard a JSON representation of the view currently displayed in the active viewport. Accepts a single optional argument:
  * `quote=1`: format the result so it can be directly parsed by `fdt apply view` as a single quoted string argument.
* `fdt apply view` - Given a saved view as a JSON string (see `fdt save view`), applies it to the active view. Takes a single required argument: the JSON string, in quotes, with interior quotation marks escaped as `""`. Use the `quote=1` argument to `fdt save view` to enquote and escape the JSON.
* `fdt apply viewid` - Accepts the Id of a persistent ViewDefinition in hexadecimal format and applies that view to the active viewport.
* `fdt save rendering style` - Outputs selected aspects of the active viewport's display style as JSON. See `DisplayStyleSettings.toOverrides`. Each argument is of the format "option=value" where `value` is 0 for false or 1 for true. All arguments default to false.

* `fdt apply rendering style` - Given a rendering style as a JSON string (see `fdt save rendering style`), applies it to the active viewport's display style. See `DisplayStyleSettings.applyOverrides`. Takes a single required argument: the JSON string.
* `fdt bgcolor` - change the background color for the active viewport. It requires a single argument - the string representation of the color. See ColorDef.fromString for supported formats.
* `fdt change viewflags` - Changes any number of ViewFlags for the active viewport. Each argument is of the format "flag=value". For boolean flags, the value is `0` for `false` or `1` for `true`. Flag names are case-insensitive.
  * Boolean flags: "dimensions", "patterns", "weights", "styles", "transparency", "fill", "textures", "materials", "acsTriad", "grid", "visibleEdges", "hiddenEdges", "lighting", "shadows", "clipVolume", "constructions", "monochrome", "backgroundMap", "ambientOcclusion", "forceSurfaceDiscard"
  * "renderMode": 0 = wireframe, 3 = hidden line, 4 = solid fill, 6 = smooth shade (numeric values of RenderMode enum).
* `fdt inspect element` - Creates a readable text summary of a geometric element or geometry part. The keyin takes the following arguments (only the first character of each is checked), all of which are optional:

* `fdt emphasize visible` - Determines the set of elements considered currently visible in the selected viewport and emphasizes them, de-emphasizing everything else. It takes one required argument and one optional argument:
  * "tiles" or "screen": The criterion by which elements are considered visible. "tiles" means the element is present in at least one tile selected for display in the view and is not hidden based on category, subcategory, symbology overrides, etc. "screen" means the element lit up at least one pixel; this does not include pixels behind other transparent pixels.
  * "nonlocatable=0|1" where `1` indicates non-locatable geometry should be considered. By default it is ignored.

If "default" is supplied as the only argument, it resets to the default settings. Otherwise, it accepts any combination of the following arguments in the form "name=value", where `name` is case-insensitive and only the first character matters:
  * "intensity" as a number in [0..1] to change FlashSettings.maxIntensity.
  * "mode" as either "brighten" or "hilite" (case-insensitive, only first character matters) to change FlashMode.
  * "duration" as the number of seconds for FlashSettings.duration.
* `fdt gpu mem limit` - Changes the value of `TileAdmin.gpuMemoryLimit` controlling how much GPU memory can be allocated to tile graphics before graphics of least-recently-drawn tiles begin to be discarded. Accepts one integer greater than or equal to zero representing the amount of memory in bytes; or one of "default", "relaxed", "aggressive", or "none". Any other input is treated as "none".
* `fdt tilesize default` - Changes the default tile size modifier used by viewports that don't explicitly override it. Accepts a floating point number greater than zero.
* `fdt tilesize viewport` - Overrides the tile size modifier for the selected viewport (if a floating point number is supplied) or clears the override (if the string "reset" is supplied). The modifier must be greater than zero.
* `fdt webgl report compatibility` - Opens a modal dialog with information about the client's level of support for various features of the iTwin.js display system.
* `fdt webgl lose context` - Force a webgl context loss.
* `fdt compile shaders` - Compile all un-compiled registered shader programs and report whether any errors occurred. Useful for testing/debugging platform-specific shader issues.
* `fdt animation interval` - Changes the `IModelApp.animationInterval` settings. Specify milliseconds in non-negative milliseconds; or anything not parseable as an integer to disable the interval callback entirely.
* `fdt query schedule script` - Queries the schedule script associated with the RenderTimeline or DisplayStyle element specified by Id. All arguments are optional:
  - "id=<Id>": The Id of the element hosting the script. If omitted, obtains the Id from the schedule script applied to the active viewport.
  - "action=<break|copy>": Specifies what to do after obtaining the script. "break" causes execution to pause in the debugger. "copy" (the default) copies the script JSON to the clipboard.
  - "elementIds=<include|count|expand>": Specifies what to do with the list of element Ids in the script. By default, they are omitted.
    * "include": Include the Ids as they are stored in the script - possibly in compressed format.
    * "expand": Include the Ids, decompressing them if they are in compressed format.
    * "count": Replace each list of Ids with the number of Ids in that list.
* `fdt visibility` - Controls whether instanced, un-instanced (batched), or all geometry is displayed in the active viewport. Accepts at most one argument; defaults to "all" if none is specified:
  * "instanced": Display only instanced geometry.
  * "batched": Display only un-instanced (batched) geometry.
  * "all": Display all geometry.
* `fdt aspect skew` - Change the aspect ratio skew of the active viewport. Accepts the floating point skew; defaults to 1.
* `fdt subcat ovr` - Change the appearance overrides for one or more subcategories in the active viewport. All arguments except the list of Ids are optional.
  * "ids=<comma separated list of subcategory Ids>"
  * "priority=<integer>"
  * "visible=<0|1>"
  * "color=<decimal integer TBGR>" (see ColorDef)
  * "weight=<integer>"
  * "transparency=<float>" from 0 (fully opaque) to 1 (fully transparent)
* `fdt layer dump` - Dump to the notification manager a JSON representation of the current plan projection settings for the selected viewport. Optional argument `copy` also copies the JSON to the clipboard.
* `fdt layer set` - change plan projection settings for the selected viewport. The first argument is required and specifies the plan projection model(s) to be affected, either as `all` or as a comma-separated list of model Ids (e.g., `0x1c,0x9a`). Subsequent arguments are optional and are used to build a PlanProjectionSettings. Any arguments omitted will get their default values. Only the first character of each argument is significant; the name of the setting is separated from the value by an `=` sign:
  * `transparency=`: transparency in [0..1].
  * `elevation=`: elevation in meters.
  * `overlay=`: 1 to draw as an overlay, 0 to draw normally (with depth).
  * `priority=`: 1 to enforce subcategory display priority, 0 to ignore.
* `fdt subcat priority` - Override display priority of one or more subcategories. Only has an effect on plan projection models. The first argument is a comma-separated list of subcategory Ids; the second is the integer priority value. Omit the second argument to clear the overrides for the specified subcategories.
* `fdt clip color` - Specify or unspecify a clip color to use for pixels inside or outside the clip region. `<color string>` must be in one of the following forms: "rgb(255,0,0)", "rgba(255,0,0,255)", "rgb(100%,0%,0%)", "hsl(120,50%,50%)", "#rrbbgg", "blanchedAlmond" (see possible values from `ColorByName`; case insensitive). At least one argument must be specified. Arguments can be:
  * "clear": Clear all clip colors
  * "inside `<color string>` | clear": Set or clear an inside clip color
  * "outside  `<color string>` | clear": Set or clear an outside clip color
* `fdt sourceId from elemId` and `fdt elemId from sourceId` - Converts between the Id of an element in the iModel and the corresponding object in the source document from which it originated. Outputs the result to IModelApp.notifications.
  * * `id=`: the source aspect Id or element Id.
  * * `copy=`: (optional) 1 to copy the resultant Id to the system clipboard.

* `fdt aasamples <nSamples>` - Sets the number of antialias samples for the current viewport where nSamples is the number of samples to use; if 1 or less then antialiasing is turned off, if > 1 then antialiasing is turned on and it will attempt to use that many samples (restricted by the given hardware constraints)
The following arguments can also be supplied:
  * `all`: (optional) sets it for all open viewports as well as all future viewports
