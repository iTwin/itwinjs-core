## Description

The __@bentley/frontend-devtools__ package contains various tools and widgets designed to help track information and diagnose issues related to the iModel.js front-end display system. It is intended chiefly for use by developers.

Because this is a developer-only package, its functionality is not expected to ever be promoted from "beta" to "public".

## Contents

* /src/FrontendDevTools.ts - entry point for initializing the package.
* /src/ui/ - rudimentary basic html controls used to build the widgets.
* /src/tools/ - a collection of immediate-mode and interactive-mode tools. All of the tools' key-in strings begin with "fdt" (as in, "Front-end Dev Tools").
* /src/widgets/ - widgets that wrap some of the package's functionality into embeddable UI controls, including:
  * `KeyinField` - allows any tool to be executed by typing in its keyin string (with autocompletion).
  * `FpsTracker` - displays the average frames-per-second.
  * `TileStatisticsTracker` - displays the state of tile requests in the system.
  * `MemoryTracker` - displays statistics about GPU memory allocated by the display system.
  * `GpuProfiler` - displays GPU timing queries and allows recording for viewing in chrome://tracing. See https://aras-p.info/blog/2017/01/23/Chrome-Tracing-as-Profiler-Frontend/ for more information.
  * `DiagnosticsPanel` - combines all of the above widgets into a single panel.

## Usage

The package must be initialized before use. This can be done when your application starts up, or deferred until first use of the package. The packages' tools will not be registered until the package is initialized.

Example of initializing at start-up:

```ts
  await IModelApp.startup();
  await FrontendDevTools.initialize();
```

An easy way to use this package is to instantiate a `DiagnosticsPanel`, supplying a `Viewport` for which the panel will supply diagnostics and tools.
You can then integrate the panel into your UI by appending its `element` HTMLElement to your DOM.

Alternatively, you can embed any configuration of the widgets into your DOM as you like.

Even if you use none of the widgets, initializing the package will make all of its tools available for use, ready to be associated with your own UI entry points or to be executed via key-in. The set of available key-ins can be found in /public/locales/en/FrontendDevTools.json.

## Key-ins

The following key-ins are delivered with this package. Each begins with the prefix `fdt`, short for "Front-end Dev Tools". Use `FrontendDevTools.initialize` to register them for use in your application.

### Toggle key-ins

The key-ins below enable, disable, or toggle a specific feature. They take at most one argument (case-insensitive):
  * "on": Display the decoration.
  * "off": Stop displaying the decoration.
  * "toggle" or no arguments: Invert the current state.

* `fdt project extents` - Toggles display of a decoration illustrating the iModel's project extents.
* `fdt freeze scene` - Toggles scene freeze for the active viewport. While scene freeze is enabled, the same set of tiles will continue to be displayed until the scene is unfrozen - no new tiles will be loaded. Useful for zooming in or out to inspect geometry inside specific tiles.
* `fdt frustum selected` - Toggles a decoration representing the current frustum of the selected viewport. The decoration is displayed in any *other* open viewports - so if no other viewports are open, this key-in has no effect.
* `fdt shadow frustum` - Like `fdt frustum selected`, but visualizes the frustum used to select tiles for the shadow map (when shadows are enabled).
* `fdt frustum snapshot` - Toggles a decoration representing the current frustum of the active viewport. The decoration remains displayed until it is toggled back off. `fdt frustum selected` is much more useful, but requires at least two open viewports.  Including `fdt snapshot preload` will also display the preload frustum decoration.
* `fdt tooltips` - Toggles debugging tooltips for element locate. When enabled, hovering over an element will display a tooltip containing information like element ID, subcategory ID, and model ID.
* `fdt metric` - Toggles use of metric quantity formatting, e.g. as used to format output from the measure tools. Turning metric "off" switches to use of imperial units.
* `fdt fadeout` - Toggles "fade-out" transparency mode for the selected viewport.
* `fdt tile requests` - When enabled, displays in each viewport the bounding boxes of all tiles currently requested for loading by the viewport that was selected at the time the key-in was executed. Green boxes indicate pending requests; red indicate requests being actively processed.
* `fdt 3dmanip` - Change the `allow3dManipulations` flag for the 3d view associated with the active viewport.
* `fdt tiletree bounds` - When enabled, draws bounding boxes representing the volume of each tile tree displayed in the active viewport.
* `fdt toggle readpixels` - Toggles "read pixels" mode on the active viewport. In this mode, geometry is rendered to the screen as if it was being rendered off-screen for element locate purposes.
* `fdt dpi lod` - Toggles whether device pixel ratio should be taken into account when computing LOD for tiles and decoration graphics.
* `fdt attachments` - Toggles display of view attachments in the sheet view associated with the active viewport.
* `fdt attachment bounds` - Toggles display of bounding boxes around each view attachment in the active viewport.
* `fdt toggle drapefrustum` - Toggles display of frustum that is used to drape classifiers and background map.
* `fdt toggle reality preload` - Toggles the display of preloaded reality tile bounding boxes.
* `fdt toggle reality freeze`  - Toggles the freezing of reality tile loading, when the reality tiles are frozen new reality tiles are not downloaded or purged.
* `fdt toggle reality logging` - Toggle the logging of reality tile loading and selection diagnostics to the console.
* `fdt toggle reality bounds` - Toggle the display of bounding boxes for reality tiles.
* `fdt set building display` Toggle the display of the worldwide OpenStreetMap worldwide buildingslayer by attaching or displaying as a reality model in the current viewport.  The OSM buildings are aggregated and supplied from Cesium Ion <https://cesium.com/content/cesium-osm-buildings/>. The first argument is required on|off - the second optional argument is a value for transparency between 0 and 1.
### Other key-ins

* `fdt save view` - Copies to the clipboard a JSON representation of the view currently displayed in the active viewport.
* `fdt apply view` - Accepts an unquoted JSON representation of a view, e.g., as obtained from `fdt save view`, and applies that view to the active viewport.
* `fdt apply viewid` - Accepts the Id of a persistent ViewDefinition in hexadecimal format and applies that view to the active viewport.
* `fdt save rendering style` - Outputs selected aspects of the active viewport's display style as JSON. See `DisplayStyleSettings.toOverrides`. Each argument is of the format "option=value" where `value` is 0 for false or 1 for true. All arguments default to false.
  * `all`: include all settings.
  * `imodel`: include iModel-specific settings.
  * `project`: include project-specific settings.
  * `map`: include background map settings.
  * `drawingaids`: include drawing aid decoration settings.
  * `copy`: copy result to system clipboard.
  * `quote`: format the result so it can be directly parsed by `fdt apply rendering style` as a single quoted string argument.
* `fdt apply rendering style` - Given a rendering style as a JSON string (see `fdt save rendering style`), applies it to the active viewport's display style. See `DisplayStyleSettings.applyOverrides`. Takes a single required argument: the JSON string.
* `fdt change viewflags` - Changes any number of ViewFlags for the active viewport. Each argument is of the format "flag=value". For boolean flags, the value is `0` for `false` or `1` for `true`. Flag names are case-insensitive.
  * Boolean flags: "dimensions", "patterns", "weights", "styles", "transparency", "fill", "textures", "materials", "acsTriad", "grid", "visibleEdges", "hiddenEdges", "lighting", "shadows", "clipVolume", "constructions", "monochrome", "backgroundMap", "ambientOcclusion", "forceSurfaceDiscard"
  * "renderMode": 0 = wireframe, 3 = hidden line, 4 = solid fill, 6 = smooth shade (numeric values of RenderMode enum).
* `fdt inspect element` - Creates a readable text summary of a geometric element or geometry part. The keyin takes the following arguments (only the first character of each is checked), all of which are optional:
  * "id=elementId" where "elementId" is a hexadecimal element Id such as `0x12cb` - can also specify as a comma-separated list of any number of elementIds;
  * "symbology=0|1" where `1` indicates detailed symbology information should be included in the output;
  * "placement=0|1" where `1` indicates detailed geometric element placement should be included; and
  * "verbosity=0|1|2" controlling the verbosity of the output for each geometric primitive in the geometry stream. Higher values = more detailed information. Note `verbosity=2` can produce megabytes of data for certain types of geometric primitives like large meshes.
  * "refs=0|1" where `1` indicates that if the element is a geometry part, the output should include a list of all geometric elements which reference that geometry part. This is **extremely** inefficient and may take a very long time to process in iModels containing many geometric elements.
  * "modal=0|1" where `1` indicates the output should be displayed in a modal dialog.
  * "copy=0|1" where `1` indicates the output should be copied to the system clipboard.
* `fdt select elements` - given a list of element Ids separated by whitespace, replace the contents of the selection set with those Ids.
* `fdt toggle skybox` - If the active viewport is displaying a spatial view, toggles display of the skybox.
* `fdt emphasize selection` - Emphasizes all elements in the selection set, and de-emphasizes all other elements by making them semi-transparent and grey. If the selection set is empty, clear the effects of any previous use of this key-in. Accepts one of the following arguments:
  * "none": Don't override color, don't apply silhouette.
  * "color": Override color to white.
  * "emphasis": Apply silhouette for emphasis.
  * "both": Apply both color and silhouette.
* `fdt isolate selection` - Causes all elements except those currently in the selection set to stop drawing.
* `fdt clear isolate` - Reverse the effects of `fdt isolate selection`.
* `fdt toggle wiremesh` - Toggles "pseudo-wiremesh" display. This causes surfaces to be rendered using `GL_LINES` instead of `GL_TRIANGLES`. Useful for visualizing the triangles of a mesh - but not suitable for "real" wiremesh display.
* `fdt tile bounds` - Sets the type of bounding volume decorations that will be displayed for each tile displayed in the view. Accepts at most one argument; if none is specified, it defaults to "volume", unless tile bounds are already displayed, in which it toggles them back off.
  * "none": Don't display bounding volumes.
  * "volume": Bounding box representing the full range of each tile.
  * "content": Tighter bounding box representing the range of geometry contained within each tile.
  * "both": Both volume and content boxes.
  * "children": For each tile, draw a box around the volume of each of its child tiles, color-coded such that green indicates an empty child tile and blue a non-empty child tile.
  * "sphere": Bounding sphere representing the full range of each tile.
* `fdt time tile load` - Purges all tile trees from memory and reloads the contents of the selected viewport. Outputs to the notifications center the time elapsed once all tiles required for the view are loaded and displayed.
* `fdt hilite settings` - Modifies the hilite settings for the selected viewport. If no arguments are specified, it resets them to the defaults. Otherwise, each argument modifies an aspect of the current settings:
  * "r", "g", or "b": An integer in [0..255] specifying the red, green, or blue component of the hilite color.
  * "v", "h": The visible or hidden ratio in [0..1].
  * "s": The silhouette as an integer in [0..2] (see Hilite.Silhouette enum).
* `fdt emphasis settings` - Modifies the hilite settings used for emphasized elements in the selected viewport. If no arguments are specified, it does nothing. See `fdt hilite settings` for supported arguments.
* `fdt tilesize default` - Changes the default tile size modifier used by viewports that don't explicitly override it. Accepts a floating point number greater than zero.
* `fdt tilesize viewport` - Overrides the tile size modifier for the selected viewport (if a floating point number is supplied) or clears the override (if the string "reset" is supplied). The modifier must be greater than zero.
* `fdt webgl report compatibility` - Opens a modal dialog with information about the client's level of support for various features of the iModel.js display system.
* `fdt webgl lose context` - Force a webgl context loss.
* `fdt compile shaders` - Compile all un-compiled registered shader programs and report whether any errors occurred. Useful for testing/debugging platform-specific shader issues.
