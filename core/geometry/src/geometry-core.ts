// REMARK:
// The docs-group-description comments are followed by empty classes with names corresponding to the doc-group.
// Normally (in committed code) these are commented out.
// The comments have distinctive strings so that simple search and replace can make the "real".
// This is useful when working on the documentation:  When the empty classes are present, VSCode will format the doc comments
// for and display them when the mouse hovers over the class name.
