# geometry-core "fromGC" test files

* These files are produced as output from the geometry-core test suite.
* The test suite itself writes them to a directory under its output.
* These files are the IModelJson representations (serialization) of objects produced by calls to methods in serialization\GeometrySamples.ts.
* When the live-output files are approved, they are copied to source\test\IModelJson\fromGC for future test of geometry coverage and round trips.
* The copied files are then checked in to git.
