# `Visualization of Some of HalfEdge Functions`

Here is visualization of some the HalfEdge functions (`createHalfEdgePair`, `splitEdge`, and `splitEdgeCreateSliverFace`). Note that edges of the graph are indicated by black lines and vertices of the graph are indicated by black dots. HalfEdges (nodes) are indicated by non-black dots. The arrow emanating from a node points to its faceSuccessor node.

# `Transverse Intersection Fractions`

Here is the math details of `HalfEdge.transverseIntersectionFractions`

<img src="./figs/Graph/transverseIntersectionFractions.png" width="500">

Let $A0 = (x_{a_0},y_{a_0}), A1 = (x_{a_1},y_{a_1}), B0 = (x_{b_0},y_{b_0}),$ and $B1 = (x_{b_1},y_{b_1})$.

The parametric equations of the lines are:

$(1-t_a)(x_{a_0},y_{a_0}) + t_a (x_{a_1},y_{a_1})$

$(1-t_b)(x_{b_0},y_{b_0}) + t_b (x_{b_1},y_{b_1})$

These 2 equations are equal at the intersection so:

$((1-t_a)x_{a_0} + t_a x_{a_1},(1-t_a)y_{a_0} + t_a y_{a_1}) = ((1-t_b)x_{b_0} + t_b x_{b_1},(1-t_b)y_{b_0} + t_b y_{b_1})$

which leads to the final equations:

$ (x_{a_1} - x_{a_0}) t_a + (x_{b_0} - x_{b_1}) t_b = x_{b_0} - x_{a_0} $

$ (y_{a_1} - y_{a_0}) t_a + (y_{b_0} - y_{b_1}) t_b = y_{b_0} - y_{a_0} $

# `Collect Connected Graph Components`

Below is the explanation of the `HalfEdgeGraphSearch.collectConnectedComponentsWithExteriorParityMasks`.

Suppose you call the following code
```
HalfEdgeGraphSearch.collectConnectedComponentsWithExteriorParityMasks(
    graph, new HalfEdgeMaskTester(HalfEdgeMask.BOUNDARY_EDGE), HalfEdgeMask.EXTERIOR,
  );
```
on the following graph where blue shows boundary nodes and red shows non-boundary nodes:

# `Traverse Graph Using Stack and Queue`
Suppose we have this half edge graph:
![>](./figs/Graph/graph.png)

Now we want to traverse the graph using stack and queue.

**Stack**<br>
A stack-based approach (implemented in `HalfEdgeGraphSearch.collectConnectedComponentsWithExteriorParityMasks`) can be used to traverse the graph.

Suppose we start from the middle face (node 63). We push nodes 63, 64, 66, and 43 to the stack and mark all of them as visited. Then we pop the top node (43) from the stack and using its edge mate (node 42 which is NOT already visited) move to the second face. Then nodes 42, 44, 15, and 41 are pushed to the stack and mark them as visited. Again we pop the top node (41) from the stack and using its edge mate (node 40 which is NOT already visited) move to the third face.

We continue this process to traverse all the faces. Note that if we pop a node from stack which is already visited, we just skip that node and pop the next node from stack.

Below is the graph image with faces numbered by red color (the only exterior face is 26). We also colored each alternate face with white and gray colors which forms the bullseye pattern.

**Queue**<br>
A queue-based approach (currently not implemented) can be used to traverse the graph.

Suppose we start from the middle face (node 63). We add nodes 63, 64, 66, and 43 to the queue and mark all of them as visited. Then we retrieve node 63 from the front of queue and using its edge mate (node 62 which is NOT already visited) move to the second face. Then nodes 62, 39, 59, and 60 are added to the queue and mark them as visited. Again we retrieve node 64 from the front of queue and using its edge mate (node 65 which is NOT already visited) move to the third face.

We continue this process to traverse all the faces. Note that if we retrieve a node from the front of queue which is already visited, we just skip that node and retrieve the next node from the front of queue.

Below is the graph image with faces numbered by red color (the only exterior face is 16).

# `Collect Boundary Loops`

Below is the explanation of the `HalfEdgeGraphSearch.collectExtendedBoundaryLoopsInGraph`.

Suppose you call the following code
```
HalfEdgeGraphSearch.collectExtendedBoundaryLoopsInGraph(graph, HalfEdgeMask.EXTERIOR);
```
on the following graph where blue and orange show boundary nodes and red shows non-boundary nodes:

![>](./figs/Graph/collectExtendedBoundaryLoopsInGraph.png)

In this image we have one boundary loop. The function collects orange nodes which represent the boundary loop and returns it in an array. Below is how the code works.

First note that we set the visit mask on every node that we visit. Now suppose we start from `node0`. Since this node represents a boundary edge, it is added to the boundary loop array. Then we move to the face successor of `node0` which is `node2`. Again it is added to the boundary loop array because this node represents a boundary edge.

After that we move to the face successor of `node2` which is `node4`. This time it is NOT added to the boundary loop array because this node does not represent a boundary edge. At this point, to find the next boundary edge, we move to the vertex predecessor of `node4` which is `node6`. This node is a boundary edge, so it is added to boundary loop array.

Next we move to the face successor of `node6` which is `node8`. It is added to the boundary loop array and we move to the face successor of `node8` which is `node5`. It is NOT added to the boundary loop array because this node does not represent a boundary edge. Therefore, we move to the vertex predecessor of `node5` which is `node0`. We have already visited this node so we have found the end of boundary loop and we return the boundary loop array: `[node0, node2, node6, node8]`
