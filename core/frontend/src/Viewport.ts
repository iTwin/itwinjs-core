/** An interactive Viewport that exists within an HTMLDivElement. ScreenViewports can receive HTML events.

 * Every frame, the ViewManager will update the Viewport's state and re-render its contents if anything has changed.
 * To halt this loop, use ViewManager.dropViewport() to remove the viewport from the ViewManager.
 *
 * A ScreenViewport internally owns significant WebGL resources which must be explicitly disposed of when the viewport is no longer needed.
 * This is achieved by invoking the viewport's dispose() method. ViewManager.dropViewport() invokes dispose() on the viewport by default.
 *
 * The lifetime of a ScreenViewport typically follows a pattern:
 * ```
 *  1. Application creates the viewport via ScreenViewport.create()
 *  2. The viewport is added to the render loop via ViewManager.addViewport()
 *  3. When the application is finished with the viewport, it removes it from the render loop and disposes of it via ViewManager.dropViewport().
 * ```
 *
 * In some cases it may be useful to temporarily suspend a viewport's render loop. In this case the lifetime of the viewport proceeds as follows:
 * ```
 *  1. Application creates the viewport via ScreenViewport.create()
 *  2. The viewport is added to the render loop via ViewManager.addViewport()
 *  3. At some point the render loop is suspended via ViewManager.dropViewport(viewport, false), indicating the viewport should not be disposed.
 *  4. Optionally, resume rendering by returning to step 2.
 *  5. When the application is finished with the viewport:
 *    5a. If it is currently registered with the ViewManager, it is dropped and disposed of via ViewManager.dropViewport()
 *    5b. Otherwise, it is disposed of by invoking its dispose() method directly.
