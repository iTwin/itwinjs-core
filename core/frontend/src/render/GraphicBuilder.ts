/** Provides methods for constructing a [[RenderGraphic]] or [[GraphicTemplate]] from geometric primitives and symbology.
 * GraphicBuilder is primarily used for creating [[Decorations]] to be displayed inside a [[Viewport]].
 *

 *  1. Use [[DecorateContext.createGraphic]] or [[RenderSystem.createGraphic]] to obtain a builder.
 *  2. Set up the symbology using [[GraphicBuilder.activateGraphicParams]] or [[GraphicBuilder.setSymbology]].
 *  3. Add one or more geometric primitives using methods like [[GraphicBuilder.addShape]] and [[GraphicBuilder.addLineString]], possibly setting new symbology in between.
 *  4. Use [[GraphicBuilder.finish]] to produce the finished [[RenderGraphic]].
 *
 * The process for constructing a [[GraphicTemplate]] is similar:
 *  1. Use [[RenderSystem.createGraphic]] to obtain a builder.
 *  2. Set up the symbology using [[GraphicBuilder.activateGraphicParams]] or [[GraphicBuilder.setSymbology]].
 *  3. Add one or more geometric primitives using methods like [[GraphicBuilder.addShape]] and [[GraphicBuilder.addLineString]], possibly setting new symbology in between.
 *  4. Use [[GraphicBuilder.finishTemplate]] to produce the finished [[GraphicTemplate]].
 *
 * @note Most of the methods which add geometry to the builder take ownership of their inputs rather than cloning them.
 * So, for example, if you pass an array of points to addLineString(), you should not subsequently modify that array.
