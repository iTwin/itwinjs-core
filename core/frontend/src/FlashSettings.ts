 *  - By mixing the viewport's hilite color as specified by [[Viewport.hilite]] with the geometry's own color; or
 *  - By brightening the geometry's own color (for lit geometry only - i.e., meshes displayed in a view with lighting enabled).
 * The flash effect starts out at an intensity of zero and increases linearly over the period of time specified by [[duration]] until
 * [[maxIntensity]] is reached.
 * @see [[Viewport.flashSettings]] to customize the flash behavior for a viewport.
 * @see [[Viewport.hilite]] to customize the hilite color used by [[FlashMode.Hilite]].
