/** A channel over which requests for tile content can be made. The channel may request content over HTTP, calls to the backend via IPC or RPC, or any other method like generating the content
 * on the frontend. The channel consists of a queue of pending requests and a set of "active" requests (dispatched and awaiting a response). Incoming requests are placed onto the queue. Requests are popped of the queue in order of priority and dispatched, until the maximum number of simultaneously-active requests is reached.
 * The maximum number of active requests depends on the transport mechanism. For HTTP 1.1, browsers impose a limit of 6 simultaneous connections to a given domain, so ideally each unique domain will use its own unique channel with a limit of 6 active requests. Even for requests satisfied entirely by the frontend, imposing a limit is important for throttling the amount of work done at one time, especially because as the user navigates the view, tiles that were previously requested may no longer be of interest and we shouldn't waste resources producing their content.
 * A channel must be registered with [[TileRequestChannels]] and must have a unique name among all registered channels.
 * @see [[TileRequestChannels.getForHttp]] to obtain (and register if not already registered) an HTTP-based channel.
 * @see [[TileAdmin.channels]] for the channels configured for use with the iTwin.js display system.
