 *  - A [[DisplayStyleState]]'s map settings or reality models;
 *  - [ViewAttachment]($backend)s in a [[SheetModelState]];
 *  - [[TiledGraphicsProvider]]s associated with a viewport.
 *

 * overridden instead to customize the behavior. For example, [[selectTiles]] should not be overridden; instead, override the[[_selectTiles]] method
