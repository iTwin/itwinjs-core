  /** Dropping and immediately re-adding an unresized viewport to the view manager would result in a black rendering
   * until the viewport was manually resized. This happened because when the viewport was removed it would have a 0,0
   * dimension, which was internally recorded (but not acted upon with regard to framebuffers). Once re-adding the viewport,
   * it would be flagged as having a size change because its dimensions were no longer 0 (they became the original
   * dimensions). Disposing and recreating the framebuffers with the same dimensions as the previous framebuffers caused the
   * black rendering in the particular case of re-adding the viewport.
   *
   * We resolved this problem by adding a check to not record a dimension change if the new dimensions are 0 -- we really
   * do not want to create framebuffers with those dimensions anyway, because that is invalid.
   *
   * This test verifies that this problem has been resolved.
