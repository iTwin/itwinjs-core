/** Represents a period of time within an [interactive editing]($docs/learning/InteractiveEditing.md) session during which the
 * geometry of elements being displayed in one or more [[Viewport]]s is being modified. Outside of such a scope, whenever the
 * geometry within a [GeometricModel]($backend) changes new [[Tile]]s must be generated to reflect those changes in a viewport.
 * Regenerating entire tiles each time individual elements change can be time-consuming, which may introduce an unacceptable delay
 * between making a modification and seeing its result on the screen.
 *
 * Within the context of a graphical editing scope, no new tiles are generated. Instead, the geometry for any deleted or modified elements
 * is hidden in the tile graphics, and additional temporary graphics are displayed for any newly-inserted or modified elements. Only when the
 * scope exits are new tiles produced.
 *
 * The application decides when to enter and exit a graphical editing scope. A single interactive editing session may involve any number of
 * editing scopes. Typically, applications will enter a new editing scope (after first exiting a previous scope, if one exists):
 *  - When switching from a non-graphical workflow to one that involves editing geometry; or
 *  - When changing which geometric model is being edited; or
 *  - After performing an operation that creates or modifies a "large" number (perhaps hundreds?) of elements.
 *
 * An application should typically exit any graphical editing scope before:
 *  - Pulling changesets; or
 *  - Switching from a graphical editing workflow to some non-graphical workflow.
 *
 * Graphical editing scopes are only supported for [[BriefcaseConnection]]s opened in read-write mode that contain version 1.0.11 or newer of the BisCore schema.
 * @see [[BriefcaseConnection.enterEditingScope]] to create a scope for a briefcase.
 * @see [[BriefcaseConnection.editingScope]] to obtain a briefcase's current scope.
 * @see [[exit]] to terminate a scope.
