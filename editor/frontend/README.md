## Project Extents and Geolocation

### Usage

Running the `editor project location show` command, with a spatial view active, enables the display of the project extents and geolocation controls.

![decoration example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iTwin/itwinjs-core/master/editor/frontend/docs/images/pl_decoration.png "Example of decoration for a geolocated imodel")

1. A clip volume representing the current project extents.
    * The current size is shown in locate tooltip using the active distance formatting.
2. Control to define the ECEF origin.
    * Click to run the `editor project geolocation point` command.
    * This control is not displayed when the imodel has a valid GCS defined.
3. Control to define the north direction.
    * Click to run the `editor project geolocation north` command.
    * This control is not displayed when the imodel isn't geolocated.
    * When a GCS is defined, the current north direction is displayed for information purposes but can't be modified.
4. Controls to define the project extents.
    * Click an arrow control to resize.

> The decorations and controls are expected to be selectable and modifiable by the default tool.

#### Changing the project extents

Use the arrow controls (#4) to resize the project extents.

> If making the project extents larger, it is helpful to have the background map displayed to avoid decoration clipping.

While there isn't hard limit imposed on the size of the project extents, when any dimension exceeds the recommend maximum a warning symbol is displayed.

For the project extents height, the recommended maximum is 2 km.

![max z extents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iTwin/itwinjs-core/master/editor/frontend/docs/images/pl_extent_z.png "Example of z extents larger than recommended")

For the project extents length and width, the recommended maximum when a GCS is defined is 350 km, and 20 km for imodels that aren't map projections (only ECEF transform defined). In addition to the warning symbols near the arrow controls, a red transparent fill is also displayed to help indicate the xy extents may be too large.

#### Adding or Updating Geolocation

If an imodel is not currently geolocated, or is incorrectly geolocated without a valid GCS defined, the geolocation control (#2) will be displayed. Clicking on this control runs the `editor project geolocation point` command, and after snapping to a known coordinate you will be prompted to enter new values for latitude, longitude, altitude, and north angle.

If the imodel is already geolocated, the tool settings is populated with the current values for the snapped coordinate. If you don't know the north direction angle, not to worry, this can be defined interactively with another control once the model has an ECEF origin defined.

![define geolocation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iTwin/itwinjs-core/master/editor/frontend/docs/images/pl_geolocate.png "Example of defining ECEF origin")

##### Interactively Defining North Direction

The north direction can set interactively by 2 points, click on the north direction control (#3) to run the  `editor project geolocation north` command.

![define north](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iTwin/itwinjs-core/master/editor/frontend/docs/images/pl_north_1.png "Example of defining north direction by 2 points")

After zooming out far enough, only the north direction control will be displayed in the view. This may be helpful for seeing where the project is located on the globe or visually confirming the proper north direction.

![north decoration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iTwin/itwinjs-core/master/editor/frontend/docs/images/pl_north_2.png "Example of north decoration when zoomed out")

> The north direction control is only displayed *after* an imodel has been geolocated.

##### Interactively Tweaking Lat/Long/Altitude

If the geolocation is *almost* correct, the latitude, longitude, and altitude can be interactively adjusted by defining a translation by 2 points.

For example, running the `editor project geolocation move` command can be used to correct an incorrect altitude for the building below that is half buried in the terrain.

![incorrect altitude](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iTwin/itwinjs-core/master/editor/frontend/docs/images/pl_move_1.png "Example of incorrect altitude")

First identify a point on the building to move from, it can be helpful turning off map locate for this point if it's below the terrain. For the second point, with map locate re-enabled and the active snap mode set to nearest, identify a point on the terrain to complete the adjustment.

> AccuDraw can be very helpful when adjusting altitude. Use the T/F/S shortcuts to orient the AccuDraw compass, use Enter (smartlock) to lock an axis to snap the 2nd point. For this example F and Enter were used to lock the up direction before changing to nearest snap for the 2nd point.

![adjusting altitude](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iTwin/itwinjs-core/master/editor/frontend/docs/images/pl_move_2.png "Example of interactively adjusting altitude")

Now we can see the building correctly adjusted for the terrain.

#### Saving And Abandoning Changes

To abandon changes to the project extents or geolocation currently being previewed, run the `editor project location cancel` command.

To turn off the display of decorations while preserving unsaved changes, run the `editor project location hide` command. Use `editor project location show` to restore preview of unsaved changes.

To save the changes being previewed, run the `editor project location save` command.
