# This config will fake successful status checks for individual CI events in a pull
# request when it detects *only* changes in the files listed below; i.e., the files
# listed under "paths:".
#
# While this config will fake a successful status check, it does *not* forego running the
# real status check. That needs to be handled by each status check events' own config;
# i.e., a Github Action's or Azure Pipeline's .yaml file.
#
# For example, if the extract-api status check is faked, the extract-api.yaml config
# needs to know for what files it should not run. (It will be faked as a successful
# check, so there is no need for it to run.)
#
# Why does this exist?
# The itwinjs-core repo requires certain status checks to be marked successful or
# neutral* to allow a pull request to be merged. Since some changes are limited in scope
# (e.g., a documentation change) or do not affect the application at all (e.g., a
# CODEOWNERS file change), there is no need to wait for or spend resources on every CI
# build to run.
#
# *Note: When Azure Pipeline builds (triggered by Azure DevOps webhooks) skip running due to
# path exclusions, their status checks are set neutral by Azure DevOps. This satisfies
# GitHub's "required" check and thus these status checks do not need to be faked below.

# HOW TO: Add New Files To The Exclusion List
# 1. Add files to *this* config to trigger
# 1. Add the glob of paths to trigger on to the "paths:" list below.
# 2. Add the same paths to the "changed-files-specific" step below.
#    IMPORTANT NOTE: The tj-actions/changed-files globs are slightly different than GitHub
#    Actions' globs. There are at least two differences to be aware of:
#    1. GitHub Actions globs require quotes if they start with a * character,
#       tj-actions globs do not.
#    2. ** matches slightly differently. For example, GitHub actions "**.md" would be
#       tj-actions **/*.md.
# 3. For any status check that should potentially be skipped and/or faked, go to the
#    status check's config and add the relevant paths to the paths exclusion list.
#    ("paths-ignore" for Github Actions and "paths.exclude" for Azure Pipelines.)
