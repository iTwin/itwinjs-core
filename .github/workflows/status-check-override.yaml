# For pull requests that only modify documentation, individual CI events may forego running.
# (This is done by each action/pipeline/event's config.) The itwinjs-core repo requires some
# of those events to have finished successfully or neutrally to allow a pull request to be
# merged.
#
# This config will fake successful status checks for such events when it detects
# *only* documentation changes in a pull request.
#
# Note: When Azure Pipeline builds (triggered by Azure DevOps webhooks) skip running due to
# path exclusions, their status checks are set neutral by Azure DevOps. This satisfies
# GitHub's "required" check and thus these status checks do not need to be faked below.
