# This CODEOWNERS file follows the format of Github's CODEOWNERS
#   Documentation for reference, https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-code-owners

# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @global-owner1 and @global-owner2 will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.

* @iTwin/itwinjs-core-ui

# The syntax used below tries to cover both files and folders in the common folder that operate per=package
# Due to syntax requirements, both can't be covered in a single line
#
# The three main folder patterns that covered are:
#   1. /common/api/{packageName}.api.md
#   1. /common/api/summary/{packageName}.exports.csv
#   1. /common/changes/@itwin/{packageName}/*.json
